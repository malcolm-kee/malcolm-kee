You have something to say.

Not because you want to be famous.

It's just something that you can't find online, something that you wish someone has written so you can read/watch it.

So you want to create.

Putting your little voice out there.

BUT!

But someone else already say something almost like that.

Somebody else that is smarter, more famous, and even more good-looking already written that.

So, you tell yourself, perhaps don't waste your time.

They say, "build it, and they will come". But what if they don't?

Nobody want to read your sh\*t.

So you dismiss your thought of creating.

Continue scrolling your News Feed, clicking the new Instagram Story.

STOP.

Go create it.

You don't have to create for "them". The faceless "them", may not come.

Create for the one. The one friend, your mum, your one sibiling.

The one that you know would listen to you, and would benefit from what you say.

Create for her.
