It's easy to become racist.

You may not like to admit it, but you may think a particular race is lazier, a particular race is greedier, a particular race is more violent.

I used to think that it's because our country is still a developing country, therefore our mindsets are uncivilized.

Nonetheless, some times ago, I heard a comment from an entrepreneur from a First-World country:

> We tried to recuit a few candidates from XXX race, and all of them are bad. We're not gonna hire them anymore.

It seems to me that, regardless of economic status, racism is just an easy trap to fall into.

So are we fated to become a racist, continuing blaming others are racists openly while being racist privately?

## A Book

Last month when I was in Denmark, I was so bored to decide to participate in a Book Club, and pick up an interesting book: [Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst][behave].

I didn't finish the book; instead, I just flip through it and focus on those interest me, and there is a chapter on racism.

In Chapter 11 of the book (Us Versus Them), everytime we make a mental separation of "us-versus-them", we will try to generalize the quality of "them", and thus racism is produced. Meanwhile, within the "us" group, we will strive to find the individual characteristics of each person.

For example, if you think of "Chinese versus Malay", then you will subconsciously trying to form a "general characteristics of Malay". From there you will start to think:

- "Hey, the last Malay candidate is so irresponsible &mdash;, I guess Malays are all irresponsible."
- "Hey, this Chinese business man saying nonsense thing about military and play with our country flag, **but**, that's just his own personal idiocy, Chinese are not like that".

<aside>

The same logic works the other way, using same concept, as a Malay you can think:

- "Hey, there is a Chinese business man disrespects our country, I guess Chinese all are selfish persons that are not patriotic."
- "Hey, some Malay people are irresponsible. But that's just some exceptions. We Malay are hardworking and honest person."

</aside>

Now we know where the racism comes from, what's the solution?

Individuate, individuate, individuate (Apology for the bad English, blame the author, he said it).

Fight your tendency to generalize person based on race (and gender, and occupation, and age...).

Just like [growth mindset](/blog/attitude-to-competency), I find that knowing the "us versus them" mindset will helps me to analyze my own racism, and minimize it.
