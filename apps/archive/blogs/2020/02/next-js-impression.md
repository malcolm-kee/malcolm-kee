Spend few hours to go through [Next.js tutorial][tutorial], my first impression is Next.js is very versatile (compared to Gatsby and Create React App). You can use it to create an application that uses SSR throughout your site or only client site, or a combination of both.

The great thing about this versatility is you can evolves your application architecture as your requirements evolves. You can starts with static site in the beginning, and introduces SSR code when you have such requirements. This flexibility is very appealing as a developer, considering business requirements today is evolving iteratively.

Also, it is very easy to learn if you already know React. No surprise here, as everything is just React and plain Node.JS code.
