title: Code Splitting
description: 'Learn to code-splitting and lazy-load Javascript code and React component.'
---

In most large-scale React applications, it is very common that your users would not need all features everytime they access your applications. Therefore, it's better if you can split the code to multiple chunks and only send down the chunks that is required (lazy-loading).

This used to be very difficult to do in a scalable way. However, thanks to webpack (and other bundler like Parcel), it has becoming very easy to setup.

We will starts with lazy-loading some Javascript code, then lazy-loading React component.

## Lazy Loading JS code

To start lazy-loading JS code, the most straightforward way is through the dynamic [`import()`][dynamic-import] syntax.

We will lazy load the code in `api.js`.

```jsx fileName=src/app.js
import * as React from 'react';
import { BusyContainer } from './busy-container';
import Movie from './movie';

// highlight-start
const loadCodeAndMovies = () =>
  import('./api').then(({ loadMovies }) => loadMovies());
// highlight-end

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    showMovies: false,
    movies: [],
    isLoading: true
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    // highlight-next-line
    loadCodeAndMovies().then(movies =>
      this.setState({ movies, isLoading: false })
    );
  }

  ...
}

export default App;
```

- The `import { loadMovies } from './api';` statement at the beginning of the file is removed.
- We define a function `loadCodeAndMoviesData`, which will use dynamic `import` to load the code and then use the loaded function `loadMovies` to make the ajax call.
- In the `componentDidMount`, we use `loadCodeAndMoviesData` to get the movies from backend.

When you try to compile the code by `npm start` now, you would get a syntax error. This is because similar to class properties, dynamic `import` is not included as part of `preset-env` nor `preset-react`, so we need to install additional plugin

1. install a babel plugin as devDependency:

   ```bash
   npm install -D @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import
   ```

1. update `.babelrc`:
   ```json fileName=.babelrc highlightedLines=5
   {
     "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"],
     "plugins": [
       "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties",
       "@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import"
     ]
   }
   ```
1. run `npm start` again.

Now you would see the following output:

```bash
Hash: f9f3a764f70be0b6cc25
Version: webpack 4.28.4
Time: 1229ms
Built at: 2019-01-07 21:45:12
Asset        Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
      0.js    57.2 KiB       0  [emitted]
      1.js  1000 bytes       1  [emitted]
index.html   470 bytes          [emitted]
   main.js    1.18 MiB    main  [emitted]  main
Entrypoint main = main.js
```

And from the Network tab of your DevTools, you should be able to see chunk `0.js` and `1.js` are loaded.

1. modify `app.js` to lazy-load `api.js`.
1. configure Babel as described.
1. test the application and ensure the code still works as before.

## Lazy Loading React Component

Once you understand dynamic `import()` for JS code, lazy-loading React Components is just using it with some React helper.

Let's lazy load our `Movie` components by modify `app.js`:

```jsx fileName=src/app.js
import * as React from 'react';
import { BusyContainer } from './busy-container';

const Movie = React.lazy(() =>
  import(/* webpackChunkName: "Movie" */ './movie')
);

const loadCodeAndMovies = () =>
  import(/* webpackChunkName: "api" */ './api').then(({ loadMovies }) =>
    loadMovies()
  );

class App extends React.Component {
  ...

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <div className="title-bar">
          <h1>React Movie App</h1>
        </div>
        <div className="button-container">
          <button onClick={this.toggleMovies} className="button">
            {this.state.showMovies ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} Movies
          </button>
        </div>
        {this.state.showMovies && (
          <React.Suspense fallback={<span>Loading Component...</span>}>
            <BusyContainer isLoading={this.state.isLoading}>
              {this.state.movies.map(movie => (
                <Movie
                  name={movie.name}
                  releaseDate={movie.releaseDate}
                  key={movie.id}
                />
              ))}
            </BusyContainer>
          </React.Suspense>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

- We wrap dynamic `import` statement with `React.lazy`, so that React knows this is a lazy-loaded Component.
- We wrap lazy-loaded component with `React.Suspense` so that React will fallback to the loading indicator whenever any component within the `React.Suspense` is waiting to be loaded.
- The comment `/* webpackChunkName: "Movie" */` is known as _webpack magic comment_. It allows us to name our chunk with a meaningful name like `api.js` instead of `0.js`. You can read about it in [this section of webpack docs][webpack-dynamic-imports].

That's it!

## (Optional) Fix Failing Jest Tests due to Dynamic Import

Because Jest runs in NodeJS, which doesn't understand dynamic import syntax, you would encounter syntax error if you try to run the tests now. Some tweaks is required in Babel.

See the following branch for the required changes.
