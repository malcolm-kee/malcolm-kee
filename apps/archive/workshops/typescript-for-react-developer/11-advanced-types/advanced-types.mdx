In this section we will discuss some advanced concepts and techniques that would helps to improve your TypeScript code.

## Type Guard

TypeScript is aware of your `if` check and able to narrow down the type. Consider the following example:

```ts live
const findEvenNumberAndDivideIt = (numbers: number[]): number => {
  const evenNumber = numbers.find((num) => num % 2 === 0);
  return evenNumber / 2; // Hey, this could be undefined!
};
```

The type error of TypeScript is valid. We can fix it by doing a null check:

```ts
const findEvenNumberAndDivideIt = (numbers: number[]): number => {
  const evenNumber = numbers.find((num) => num % 2 === 0);
  if (evenNumber) {
    return evenNumber / 2;
  }
  return 0;
};
```

TypeScript is smart enough to know that once you do a null check, the value will no longer be `undefined`.

### Custom Type Guard

Many times you want to abstract away common type check, like `isDefined` function:

```ts
const isDefined = (value: any) => typeof value !== 'undefined';
```

Now if we apply to the `findEvenNumberAndDivideIt` example:

```ts live
const isDefined = (value: any) => typeof value !== 'undefined';

const findEvenNumberAndDivideIt = (numbers: number[]): number => {
  const evenNumber = numbers.find((num) => num % 2 === 0);
  if (isDefined(evenNumber)) {
    // This could be undefined??? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
    return evenNumber / 2;
  }
  return 0;
};
```

This is because TypeScript will not go into the implementation of `isDefined` to figure our the implementation. For TypeScript it is just a function that returns a boolean value.

We can restore the previous typechecking ability by making the `isDefined` function as custom type guard:

```ts live
const isDefined = <T>(value: T | undefined): value is T =>
  typeof value !== 'undefined';

const findEvenNumberAndDivideIt = (numbers: number[]): number => {
  const evenNumber = numbers.find((num) => num % 2 === 0);
  if (isDefined(evenNumber)) {
    // Oh my lord TypeScript is happy again 🙏🙏
    return evenNumber / 2;
  }
  return 0;
};
```

<Exercise title="Do It: Creating Type Guard">

Refactor all the functions in `typecheck.ts` so that they becomes typeguard.

## Type Utilities

### Omit

`<Form />`

`<Input />`

### Pick

- Opposite of `Omit`

```ts live
type ThirdPartyProps = {
  color: 'default' | 'success' | 'danger' | 'info' | 'warning';
  size?: 'large' | 'small';
  children: string;
};

type MyProps = Pick<ThirdPartyProps, 'color' | 'size'>;
```

<aside>

`Pick` is not that useful compared to `Omit` because there are workaround. The previous example could be achieved with

```ts noWrapper
type MyProps = {
  color: ThirdPartyProps['color'];
  size?: ThirdPartyProps['size'];
};
```
