Redux can be understood as combination of two concepts: reducer and event emitter.

## Reducer

There are few Array methods that are used heavily in redux.

- Array.map - item transformation
- Array.filter - item filtering
- Array.concat - item appending
- Array.reduce - generate a single value by going through each item

<aside>

If you're new to these Array methods, go through [Array methods module](/js-the-react-parts/array-methods) in JavaScript: The React Parts.

</aside>

The function that you pass to Array.reduce is known as reducer function, or simply _reducer_.

A reducer accept two parameters, prevState and currentItem, then returns newState.

```javascript
const reducer = (prevState, currentItem) => newState;
```

- reducer should be a [pure function](/js-the-react-parts/functional-programming#pure-function).

## Event Emitter

An event emitter is an object that will emit events and trigger all the subscribers listens for the event.

In its simplest form, event emitter exposes two methods, `subscribe` and `emit`.

```javascript
const evEmitter = createEventEmitter();
evEmitter.subscribe((val) => console.log(`Event emitted with value ${val}`));
evEmitter.emit('hello');
evEmitter.emit('bye');
```

<aside>

Event emitter is an implementation of observer design pattern, which allows multiple components/modules to communicate with each other without tight coupling between them.

</aside>

Event emitter is used heavily in JavaScript. For instance, all DOM elements are event emitters, and that's how you respond to DOM event.

```javascript
document
  .getElementById('btn')
  .addEventListener('click', () => console.log('btn is clicked!'));
```

How does the code of `createEventEmitter` looks like?

```js live
const createEventEmitter = () => {
  const subscribers = [];
  const subscribe = (subscriber) => {
    subscribers.push(subscriber);
  };
  const emit = (value) => {
    subscribers.forEach((sub) => typeof sub === 'function' && sub(value));
  };

  return {
    subscribe,
    emit,
  };
};

const evEmitter = createEventEmitter();
evEmitter.subscribe((val) => console.log(`Event emitted with value ${val}`));
evEmitter.emit('hello');
evEmitter.emit('bye');
```

- `createEventEmitter` utilizes closure in JavaScript. With closure, the `subscribe` and `emit` functions have access to `subscribers` array.
- If closure is new to you, you can go through the [closure](/js-the-react-parts/closure) section in JavaScript: The React Parts.
