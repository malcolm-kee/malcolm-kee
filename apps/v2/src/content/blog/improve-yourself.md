## Opportunity

When you see other people having a better opportunity even though you think you're more deserve than him, calm down.

Calm down and think.

If you're good, opportunity will always come.

But you're not good, you say, because you're not given the opportunity.

Then, improve yourself to the point where you'll given opportunity to improve further.

The best way is to **Improve Yourself**.

## Competition

When you're in a industry that competitors are using bad tactics and use cost-cutting tactics to chase to bottom, making you having a hard life.

Be cool.

If you're good, customer can tell.

More importantly, be so good that you raise the expectation of your industry.

Be an inspiration to other people.
