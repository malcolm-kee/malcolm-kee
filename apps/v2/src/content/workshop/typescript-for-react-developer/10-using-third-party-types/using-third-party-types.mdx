## Using Types from TypeScript and Libraries

Many open source projects include type definition by default, e.g. `redux`, `redux-thunk`. When you use those package with TypeScript, the package would just work without additional configuration on your side.

However, some popular packages does not comes with type definition, e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, and `classnames`. However, as many people use them with TypeScript, you can install the type definition separately (which are maintained separately). For instance, we install `@types/classnames` for `classnames` package.

<Exercise title="Do It: Installing Type Definition">

Convert `<Slide />` component (`slide.tsx`) and install the required type definition.

## Create Types for Third-Party Libraries

Example: `simple-format-number`

```ts fileName=type.d.ts
declare module 'simple-format-number' {
  export default function format(
    num: number,
    options?: {
      fractionDigits?: number;
      symbols?: {
        decimal?: string;
        grouping?: string;
      };
    }
  ): string;
}
```

## Extending Third-Party Typing

Sometimes, the type definition of the libraries (and even those comes with TypeScript) may be outdated and you may want to extends them. This section teach you how to do that.

Examples: `share` function that use [`navigator.share` Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share).

Examples: `Image` component that use `loading` props on `img` tag.

Examples: `DateInput` using `JQuery`
