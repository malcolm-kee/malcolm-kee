In this section, we will discuss about webpack and the ecosystem around it.

## [webpack]

Modern JS applications usually involved hundreds, if not thousands of files/functions. It would be painful and error-prone if we just include `<script>` tags in our html file manually.

This may not seems obvious to us now because currently we have only two components `App` and `Movie`. However, even with only two components, we need to bear in mind that `React` and `ReactDOM` are our dependencies and we need to ensure our code only run after they are loaded. Try to move our script tag above the `React` and `ReactDOM` script tags, and you realize our code no longer works because React code has not loaded yet.

Now imagine you have 50+ components and more than 20 dependencies, and there are some inter-dependencies between those files, manually analyzing and rearranging your script tags would be very painful, if not impossible.

webpack is the tools that solves this problem. It allows us to use JS module system like [commonjs] (e.g. `const React = require('react')`) and [ECMAScript Module][ecma-module] (e.g. `import React from 'react'`) by parsing them and create a single bundled output file. On top of that, webpack has been extended to handle all types of files that involved in a modern web application, e.g. css, images, html etc.

### Bundling code with webpack

To use webpack in your project:

1. Install it in your project:

   ```bash
   npm install -D webpack webpack-cli
   ```

1. Create a folder and call it `src`. Move your `script.js` into this folder and rename it as `index.js`.
1. Add the following npm scripts:

   ```json title="package.json" {3}
   {
     "scripts": {
       //...
       "build": "webpack --mode=\"development\""
     }
   }
   ```

1. Run `npm run build`

- webpack will produces a file call `main.js` in `dist` folder.
  - webpack will includes some additional code (known as webpackBootstrap). The code is the runtime of webpack to manage your dependencies and perform some magic e.g. lazy-loading (which we will explain later).
  - If you update your `index.html` to use script from `dist/main.js`, the code should works as before.

Now that webpack is processing our file, let's utilize webpack by splitting `App` and `Movie` into their own module/file:

1. Create a file alongside `index.js` and call it `movie.js`.
1. Cut and paste the `Movie` component into `movie.js`.
1. At the bottom of the `movie.js`, add the following statement:
   ```js
   export default Movie;
   ```
1. Create another file and call it `app.js`.
1. Cut and paste the `App` component into `app.js`.
1. At the top of the `app.js`, add the following statement:
   ```js
   import Movie from './movie';
   ```
1. At the bottom of the `app.js`, add the following statement:
   ```js
   export default App;
   ```
1. All `App` and `Movie` code should be removed from `index.js` now. Add the following statement at the top of `index.js`:
   ```js
   import App from './app';
   ```

Functionally, our code still works the same. However, now we organize our code with modules and dependencies between them are managed by webpack.

- `import` statement is used to include code that the module depends on. For our example above:
  - `app.js` depends on `movie.js`
  - `index.js` depends on `app.js`
- `export` statement is used to declare the code that is exposed to other modules.
  - there are two types of `export` statement, i.e. default export and named export.
  - We use default export in our files currently. You can read more about them [here][export-docs].

<Exercise title="Exercise">

1. Install webpack and configure build script based on the instruction above.
1. Verify that your code still works as before.
1. (Bonus) use named exports for `movie.js`.

</Exercise>

### Bundling external dependencies

Now webpack is managing dependencies between our codes (`index.js`, `app.js` and `movie.js`), let's take one step further to utilize it to manage the our dependencies to React and ReactDOM.

1. Install React and ReactDOM: `npm install react react-dom`. Note that there is no `-D` flag as we need React and ReactDOM in our application code, not tools during development/building.
1. At the top of your `index.js`, add the following statements:

   ```js title="src/index.js"
   import * as React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   ```

1. At the top of `app.js` and `movie.js`, add the following statement:
   ```js
   import * as React from 'react';
   ```
1. Remove the unpkg script tags for React and ReactDOM in your `index.html`.
1. Run `npm run build` again. Verify that your code still works as before.

<Exercise title="Exercise">

1. Install React and ReactDOM as the dependencies of the project.
1. Bundle them together by including changes as described above.
1. Verify that your code still works as before.

### webpack-dev-server and html-webpack-plugin

[`webpack-dev-server`][webpack-devserver] is a webpack feature that would ease your development by starting up a web server to serve your code. We will use it with [`html-webpack-plugin`][htmlwebpackplugin] so that even our `index.html` will be managed by webpack.

1. install required packages as devDependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i -D webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin
   ```
1. create a file `webpack.config.js` with the following content. `webpack.config.js` is the file that allows you to customize behavior of webpack. There are [many configurations][webpack-configurations] that you can do here, e.g. specify the entry points (if you entry point is not `src/index.js`) or the output folder (if you want to put the output in the folder with name other than `dist`).

   ```js title="webpack.config.js"
   const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

   /**
    * @type {import('webpack').Configuration}
    */
   module.exports = {
     devServer: {
       port: 9200,
     },
     plugins: [
       new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
         template: 'index.html',
       }),
     ],
   };
   ```

1. remove `<script src="dist/main.js"></script>` from `index.html` because webpack will help you to inject it.
1. add a `start` npm script:

   ```json title="package.json" {3}
   {
     "scripts": {
       ...
       "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode=\"development\" --open"
     }
   }
   ```

1. run `npm start` (`npm run start` works too). This should open your default browser with the url [http://localhost:9200/](http://localhost:9200/).
1. try modify your code now. webpack will help you to refresh browser.

### Bundling for production

You may realize that the current output file of webpack has tons of comments and spaces, which is good for us to read and understand what it is doing, but bad to be included to production as those comments are not useful for our customers/users.

To create a production bundle for our app:

1. Add the following npm script in `package.json`:
   ```json title="package.json"
   "build:prod": "webpack --mode=\"production\""
   ```
1. run `npm run build:prod`

<Exercise title="Exercise">

1. configure webpack-dev-server as described and run it. Verify it recompile and refresh your browser when you make change to your code.
1. configure build:prod npm scripts as described above. Verify the produced `main.js` is minified, and the file size is much smaller now.

</Exercise>

### Other features of webpack

Note that webpack is much more powerful than I've described above. The following common use cases of webpack are omitted here, but you should have a read after this workshop.

- [`style-loader`][style-loader] and [`css-loader`][css-loader]: allow you to import `.css` file in your javascript file, which will be injected as `<script>` tag in html.
- [Hot Module Replacement][hot-module-replacement] used in conjunction with [`react-hot-loader`][react-hot-loader] allows you to tweak React components while maintaining state.
- [`dotenv-webpack`][dotenv-webpack] allows you to define environment variables. This is very commonly used to set environment specific variables, e.g. API endpoints, variables to set logging behavior etc.
- [`webpack-merge`][webpack-merge] allows you to merge webpack configurations. This is useful when you have multiple webpack configurations for different purpose (development optimized for compilation time, production optimized for runtime performance), and this package allows you to merge webpack configurations instead of copy-pasting the configurations.

## [Babel]

![Babel logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/djzsjzasg/image/upload/c_scale,w_500/v1674370180/malcolm-kee/babel-logo_ckpk3b.png)

- In our current code, we use new JS feature/syntax like arrow-function, `const` and `class`. However, only modern browser recognize those JS syntax - it will cause parsing error in older browser like IE 11. You can confirm this by opening [http://localhost:9200/](http://localhost:9200/) using IE.
- Babel is the tool that allow us to write modern JS while maximizing backward compatibility.
- Babel is a compiler that compile your modern JS code (usually called ES2015+, or ES6+) to the older JS code.
- You can see Babel in action at [https://babeljs.io/repl](https://babeljs.io/repl).

### Compiling code with Babel

- Babel allows few usage options, e.g. as a CLI tool or plugin to other build system.
- Since we are using webpack, we will use `babel-loader` to integrate babel into our project.
- To include Babel as part of our webpack bundling process:

  1. Install required packages:
     ```bash
     npm install -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader
     ```
  1. Create a `.babelrc` file with the following content. This file tells Babel what transformation to perform.
     ```json title=".babelrc"
     {
       "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
     }
     ```
  1. Create a `.browserlistrc` file with the following content. This specifies what browser you supports. `@babel/preset-env` use this information to decide what syntax it needs to transform and what can be leave it as-is.
     ```text title=".browserlistrc"
     > 1%
     not ie <= 8
     ```
  1. Update `webpack.config.js` file by adding `module.rules` section, like the following content. This configuration tells webpack to run through all file ends with `.js` or `.jsx` extension through the `babel-loader`.
     ```javascript title="webpack.config.js" {1-9}
     module.exports = {
       module: {
         rules: [
           {
             test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
             exclude: /node_modules/,
             use: ['babel-loader'],
           },
         ],
       },
       devServer: {
         port: 9200,
       },
       plugins: [
         new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
           template: 'index.html',
         }),
       ],
     };
     ```
  1. Terminate your webpack-dev-server if it's running by Ctrl+C. Run `npm start` start it again. This is because configuration change will not be picked up by webpack-dev-server while it is running.
  1. Open [http://localhost:9200/](http://localhost:9200/) with IE and verify your code should works now.

<Exercise title="Exercise">

1. Configure Babel as described above.
1. Restart webpack-dev-server and verify that the application works in IE.

## Cleaning Up

As our code has been reorganized, with introduction of webpack, let's update our npm scripts accordingly. Update `format` and `lint` script in `package.json`:

```json title="package.json" {3,4}
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "format": "prettier --write src/**/*.{js,jsx}",
    "lint": "eslint src/**/*.{js,jsx} --quiet"
  }
}
```
