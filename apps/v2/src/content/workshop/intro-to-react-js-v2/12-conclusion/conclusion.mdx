We have come to the conclusion of this workshop.

## Recap

What we've learnt:

- Start a new React project with Create React App
- How to organize your JS code with module system
- Declare React components with JSX
- Extracting and composing React components
- Declare state with `React.useState` hook
- Make side effects e.g. ajax call with `React.useEffect` hook
- Extracting hooks to custom hooks
- Implement a form in React
- Share states between React components
- Write unit tests for React components
- Code splitting using dynamic `import()`, `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense`

## Next Step

- Read [React docs][react-docs]. The core API of React is pretty small now, you can finish the whole docs in one-go.
- If you prefer video, there is a free [egghead.io course][eggheadio-react-intro] by Kent C. Dodds. I never go though this course myself, but I learnt from the instructor via other course, and he is a good teacher.
- If you like to read, there is a curated list of resources at [this repo][react-redux-links]. There are too many articles to read there (I never finished them myself), just browse through the list and read what interest you.
- If you want to ask question, [reactiflux] is a good place as there are many helpful people there. It's actually React community that hang out on Discord (a messenger app like Telegram). I hang out there sometimes too.
