We will now learn how to create a React project and host the repo in GitHub

## Create React App

[Create React App][create-react-app] is a CLI tools that help you to create a project with all the required configurations for a typical React applications, e.g. webpack, Babel, and ESLint.

<aside>

In you're interested on basic understanding on those tools and how to configure them, you can refer to [version 1 of this workshop](/intro-to-react-js/introduction), where I will explain the purpose of each tools and guide you through step-by-step on how to configure them for a React project.

### Create the Project

To create the project for our app, in your CLI, go to the directory that you want to create the project, and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app react-movie-app
```

- the command will create a folder `react-movie-app` and install all the required dependencies for your project. Have fun waiting :)
- `npx` is a `npm` utility that allows you to run CLI tools conveniently. Without `npx`, you need to run 2 commands:
  ```bash
  npm install -g create-react-app
  create-react-app react-movie-app
  ```

After the command finish running, go into the folder and open it with VS code:

```bash
cd react-movie-app
code .
```

You should see the project structure as below:

Run the following command in the CLI, and your browser should open with the default Create React App application:

```bash
npm start
```

## Host Your Repo in GitHub

Now that we've created the project, it's always good practice to host your repo somewhere instead of just on your PC, as you would never know when your PC will give you a surprise.

We will host our repo in GitHub.

1.  Create a new repo in GitHub (via [this link][create-github-repo] or click the New button in your GitHub profile).
1.  Name the repo as "react-movie-app" (or something else if you wish). Click "Create Repository" button.
1.  Follow the "...push an existing repository from the command line" instruction on the page by running the command in your `react-movie-app` folder. It should be something like this:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/malcolm-kee/react-movie-app.git
    git push -u origin master
    ```

1.  Refresh the GitHub page. You should be able to see your code is available at the GitHub repo now.

## Transferring Code to the Project

Now that we have a project, let's move our code to this project.

1.  Include our html code into `public/index.html` except the `script` tags.
1.  Replace the content of `src/index.js` with our code within the `script` tag. Remove all imports except `React` and `ReactDOM` imports. If you don't know what these imports statements are, no worries, I'll explain them shortly.
1.  Delete all the files in `src` folder except `index.js` file.

Now when you run `npm start` the application should be as per before.

Commit your code and push to your GitHub repo.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "transfer code to project"
git push
```
