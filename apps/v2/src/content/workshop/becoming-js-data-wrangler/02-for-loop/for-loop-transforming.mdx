Transforming is the process of changing the item of an array to another format.

You can go through all items in JavaScript using either:

1. [Traditional `for` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)
1. [`for...of` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)

`for...of` loop is easier to read, but you do not have access to `index` variable.
