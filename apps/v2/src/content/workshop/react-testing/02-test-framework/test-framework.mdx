Before diving into specific testing framework like Vitest, it's important to understand the fundamental building blocks of any test framework.

At its core, a test framework needs two main components:

1. A test runner that executes tests and reports results.
1. An assertion system that verifies expected outcomes.

## Test Runner

The first tool that we need is test runner. A test runner is a utility that allows you to declare your test, which will be executed and the result of the test will be displayed.

Consider the following code:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

Let's write a test for it. What is a test? _A test is a piece of code that throws error when your code does not behave as expected._

<LiveEditor>

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

function testAdd() {
  const result = add(1, 2);
  const expected = 3;
  if (result !== expected) {
    throw new Error(`${result} is not equal to ${expected}`);
  }
}

function testAddMinus() {
  const result = add(100, -50);
  const expected = 50;
  if (result !== expected) {
    throw new Error(`${result} is not equal to ${expected}`);
  }
}

try {
  testAdd();
  console.log('✔ test pass');
} catch (e) {
  console.error('❌ test fail');
  console.error(e);
}

try {
  testAddMinus();
  console.log('✔ test pass');
} catch (e) {
  console.error('❌ test fail');
  console.error(e);
}
```

</LiveEditor>

> Change the `add` function to make the test fail and verify the error is shown.

As you may already realize, the message now is not very helpful, and there is many duplication in our code, let's create a utility `test` function:

```js live
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

function test(testName, executeTest) {
  try {
    executeTest();
    console.log(`✔ ${testName}`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(`❌ ${testName}`);
    console.error(e);
  }
}

test('add 1 and 2 equals 3', () => {
  const result = add(1, 2);
  const expected = 3;
  if (result !== expected) {
    throw new Error(`${result} is not equal to ${expected}`);
  }
});

test('add 100 and -50 equals 50', () => {
  const result = add(100, -50);
  const expected = 50;
  if (result !== expected) {
    throw new Error(`${result} is not equal to ${expected}`);
  }
});
```

The `test` utility function allows us to declare a test, which will be executed and log the result to console.

## Assertion

Note that we still have some duplication of the `result` and `expected`, we can write a `expect` utility function to make it more readable:

```js live
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

function test(testName, executeTest) {
  try {
    executeTest();
    console.log(`✔ ${testName}`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(`❌ ${testName}`);
    console.error(e);
  }
}

function expect(result) {
  return {
    toBe(expected) {
      if (result !== expected) {
        throw new Error(`${result} is not equal to ${expected}`);
      }
    },
  };
}

test('add 1 and 2 equals 3', () => {
  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});

test('add 100 and -50 equals 50', () => {
  expect(add(100, -50)).toBe(50);
});
```

The `expect` utility that we have just created is known as assertion utility. An assertion utility helps us to make comparison and throw error when the comparisons is not expected.

## Next Step

Test runner and assertion utility are already included as part of Jest. We'll use Jest to write tests for our application in next section.
