[`jscodeshift`](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) is a toolkit for creating codemods (code transformations) and running them. However, its [README](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift#jscodeshift--) and [docs](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift/wiki/jscodeshift-Documentation) can be quite challenging to understand. This is my documentation on it based on my understanding. Use their docs as source of truth in case there is any deviation.

There are two parts of `jscodeshift`, as a command (you use it by typing command into your terminal) and as a library (you use it in your js code). This note will focus on the second part, using it as a library to write code that transform your code.

## Creating a Transform Module

The first step of using `jscodeshift` is to create a transform module, which is a js file that exports a transformer function. For example:

```js
module.exports = function transformer(fileInfo, api, options) {
  const source = fileInfo.source;

  // change source code here

  return source; // return changed code
};
```

The transformer function is called once for each file that will be transformed. It receives three parameters:

1. `fileInfo`: Info about file being transformed, contains two properties: `path` (file path) and `source` (file content). Most of the time we only use the `source` property because code transformation is usually based on coding pattern instead of where the code is, however `path` is there just in case you need it.
1. `api`: An object that exposes 4 properties:

   - `jscodeshift`: This is the `jscodeshift` library that provides utility for you to navigate and change the source code. We will go through them in details slightly later.
   - `j`: This is an alias of `jscodeshift`. There is no difference with `jscodeshift` property except that you only need to type one character instead of eleven.
   - `stats`: A function to collect statistics. I don't have use case for it so refer to their docs.
   - `report`: call this if you want to log something. Its purpose is like `console.log` for us, since `console.log` doesn't work in transform module. This behavior is because transform module does not run on main NodeJS thread, but as a separate worker thread.

1. `options`: all the options that are passed to jscodeshift command. I have no use of this so please refer to [official docs](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift#options) instead.

### Optional: Define Parser

Because there are few flavors of JavaScript with syntax difference between them, `jscodeshift` allows us to specify which parser should be used when parsing our source code by exporting a `parser` property.

```js twoslash {9}
module.exports = function transformer(fileInfo, api, options) {
  const source = fileInfo.source;

  // change source code here

  return source; // return changed code
};

module.exports.parser = 'ts';
```

The value of `parser` could be `babel`, `babylon`, `flow`, `ts`, or `tsx`.

## Using `jscodeshift` library

When using `jscodeshift`, the main data structure that we you interact with mostly is `Collection`, which exposes methods to navigate and modify the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of your code.

### `Collection`

`Collection` is a custom data structure in `jscodeshift` to represent a list of code elements, which you can used for further filtering (like searching for certain code syntax) or manipulation (like replace them with something else). We can get a `Collection` object by calling `jscodeshift` (or `j`).

In the snippet below, we get a collection object that represent the source code, and return them.

```js {1,5}
module.exports = function transformer(fileInfo, { j }, options) {
  const collection = j(fileInfo.source);

  // change source code here

  return collection.toSource(); // return changed code
};
```

Following are the methods in `Collection` object:

#### `.find(selector: AstTypes.Type): Collection`

Returns a new `Collection` object containing all the descendant nodes that match the given selector. The selector is one of the types provided by the package [`ast-types`](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types/tree/master) that are exposed in the `jscodeshift` object, e.g. `j.FunctionExpression`.

Example:

```js
module.exports = function transformer(fileInfo, { j }, options) {
  const collection = j(fileInfo.source);

  const allFunctionExpressions = collection.filter(j.FunctionExpression);

  return collection.toSource(); // return changed code
};
```

The full list of the available types are listed in [this file](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types/blob/master/src/gen/namedTypes.ts).

#### `.filter(predicateFn): Collection`

Returns a new `Collection` object containing all the nodes in the collection that when provided to the `predicateFn`, returns `true` as result. This is equivalent to the `.filter` method on `Array`.

`predicateFn` will be called with `Node` as its first parameter.

Example:

```js {5-11}
module.exports = function transformer(fileInfo, { j }, options) {
  const collection = j(fileInfo.source);

  const allFunctionDeclarations = collection.filter(j.FunctionDeclaration);

  // exclude function declaration with name specialFunction
  const filteredFunctionDeclarations = allFunctionDeclarations.filter((path) => {
    const { node } = path;
    return node.id.name !== 'specialFunction';
  });

  return collection.toSource();
};
```

#### `.forEach(callback): Collection`

Invokes the given callback function for each node in the current collection.

Example:

```js {4-8}
module.exports = function transformer(fileInfo, { j }, options) {
  const collection = j(fileInfo.source);

  const allVariableDeclarations = collection.filter(j.VariableDeclaration);
  // Log the name of each variable declaration in a file
  allVariableDeclarations.forEach((path) => {
    const { node } = path;
    console.log(node.id.name);
  });

  return collection.toSource();
};
```

#### `.replaceWith(callback): Collection`

Replaces each node in the current collection with the result of calling the given callback function.

The callback function will be called with a Path object as its first parameter. The Path object is a reference to the current node being processed, and provides additional information and methods for working with the node.

Example:

```js {5-14}
module.exports = function transformer(fileInfo, { j }, options) {
  const collection = j(fileInfo.source);

  const allFunctionDeclarations = collection.filter(j.FunctionDeclaration);

  // Replace all function declarations with arrow function expressions
  allFunctionDeclarations.replaceWith((path) => {
    const { node } = path;
    return j.variableDeclaration('const', [
      j.variableDeclarator(node.id, j.arrowFunctionExpression(node.params, node.body)),
    ]);
  });

  return collection.toSource();
};
```

The returned value is an AST, which can be constructed with builder. They looks mostly similar to the types used for `.filter`, but in lowercase. We can find the full list of them [here](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types/blob/master/src/gen/builders.ts#L3747).

#### `.insertBefore(content: string | AST | Collection): Collection`

Inserts the given content before each node in the current collection.

The content parameter can be a string, an AST node, or another Collection object.

```js
// Add a new import statement to the top of the file
collection.insertBefore(
  j.importDeclaration(
    [j.importSpecifier(j.identifier('foo'), j.identifier('foo'))],
    j.literal('foo')
  )
);
```

Similar to `.replaceWith` method, use builders to create the code you want.

#### `.insertAfter(content: string | AST | Collection): Collection`

Inserts the given content after each node in the current collection.

The content parameter can be a string, an AST node, or another Collection object.

#### `.remove(): Collection`

Removes all nodes in the current collection.

#### `.toSource(): string`

Returns the modified code as string.
