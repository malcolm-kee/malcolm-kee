## React Model

React allow us to model UI as data flows:

1. rendering that transform data into UI
1. responding to UI event by updating data [^1]

## Applying UCM Model to React

There are two groups of React components:

- components whose main responsibility is to translate data (props) into JSX
- components whose main responsibility is to coordinate the components, updating states and integrate with services.

The idea of separating the UI objects (React elements) and managing other logics is aligned with the concept of User interface-control-model (UCM) architecture.

Applying UCM model to React application development leads us to the idea of [presentational and container components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).

Although UCM model provides guidance on how to organize the code, but without careful design, separating presentational and container components just move the code complexity from one component to another, understanding the code is not easier than not separating them.

To makes our UI code easier to be understood and maintained, we need a model/technique that we can use to organize the code in container component (control object).

## Finite State Machine

[^1]: I am using UI event very loosely here, which includes events emitted by browser as well as emitted by React (lifecycle hooks and `useEffect`).
