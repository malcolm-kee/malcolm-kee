title: 'React Server Component'
---

What matters to user is the final HTML, not the intermediate data structure.

But often we need the data to pass through component to render the React elements, which will then be translated to HTML elements.

What if the rendering happens on Server, and the output React elements is sent over the wire?

That's React Server Component.
