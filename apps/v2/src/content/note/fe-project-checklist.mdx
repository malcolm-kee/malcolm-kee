title: 'Frontend Project Checklist'
---

This is a checklist that I use when evaluating frontend projects. Although it is not exhaustive, it is meant to provide a good starting point for evaluating the quality of a frontend project.

## What Matters

### Fulfilling Requirements

If not fulfilled, it could be fine if a justification is provided.

### Idiomatic TypeScript

### Project Structure

### Tests

### Development Automation

- Linting, formatting
- Add `scripts` to `package.json` to automate common tasks
- Setup CI/CD to automate deployment

### Documentation

A good README.

## What Doesn't Matter

### The use of a high-level tool

When I say "high-level tool", what I mean is the library or meta-framework that abstract away the tedious configuration and plumbing to stitch multiple low level tools together. Choosing a specific high-level tool is mostly a matter of preference, and it is not a good indicator of the quality of a project. However, it does matter if you choose a **type of tool** to achieve specific requirements, e.g. choosing a SSR framework itself is a plus point when requirements includes SEO, but choosing NextJS over Remix is not.

For examples:

- Create React App versus Vite,
- Jest versus Vitest,
- NextJS versus Remix
