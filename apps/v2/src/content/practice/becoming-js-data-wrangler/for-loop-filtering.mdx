title: 'For Loop Filtering'
---

import CodingExercises from '~/components/CodingExercises.astro';

Filtering is the process of including/excluding items in an array based on certain condition.

You can go through all items in JavaScript using either:

1. [Traditional `for` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)
1. [`for...of` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)

`for...of` loop is easier to read, but you do not have access to `index` variable.
