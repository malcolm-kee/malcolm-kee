As a programmer that mainly developing for web application (mainly with React), I've recently trying to learn Flutter.

I find some of the terminologies in Flutter can be translated to React pretty nicely, so here there are:

| Flutter        | React           |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Widget         | Component       |
| `build` method | `render` method |

Note: to be updated as I encounter more.
