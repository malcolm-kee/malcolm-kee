title: No Perfect Time

I used to write quite often on this site.

Then today I realize it has been more than half a year since my last blog post.

The reason that I stop writing is not because that I am getting busier (I was busy before my last post).

It's because the current site that you're looking at (a GatsbyJS site) has became legacy code, as in it crash everytime I update, without helpful error message.

So I was planning that I should migrate this site to NextJS before I start writing again.

But then today I have an epiphany: the content matters more than the tech stack that I use.

Nobody cares that whether this site is legacy as long as the content is helpful.

The way I making that the obstacle for me to write more is just idiotic.

There is no perfect time to create.

Keep creating.

So you will see more mumble jumble from me after this.

Stay tuned. :)
