I have problem posting any opinion in social media.

Not because I don't have opinion.

In fact, I have plenty of them.

My problem is I always doubt myself will change my opinion anytime soon.

Compared to how a smarter person judges himself, stupid person thinks of themselves as a smarter person.

The technical name of this human tendency is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, and the chart look like this.

<img src={chartImg} alt="Dunning-Kruger Effect Chart" />

As you can see in the chart, stupid persons (the beginning of the chart rates themselves highly), while a slightly smarter person think very low of themselves, until they spend many times improve themselves until they get good, but they never rate themselves as high as the stupid one.

Everytime I feel like saying something, I always remind myself of this chart.

When I think I want to say something smart, maybe I am at the peak of stupidity.

Of course, I can use the "strong opinion, weakly held" disclaimer to justify myself.

But I think that's just the phrase people use to defend their desire to say anything as they wish without giving valid justification.

Shame on you if you're doing that.

So if you're someone that like to post many comments on social media, do I look down on you?

No worries, my friend.

I am doubtful of my own view.

Which is kinda stupid.

Now when I say myself stupid, am I trying to imply you're at the peak of stupidity, while I am at the valley of despair (not the best, but still better than you)?

Honestly, I have no idea.

But you can't judge me. This is my blog.
