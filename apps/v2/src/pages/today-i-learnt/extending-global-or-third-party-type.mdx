When you install TypeScript in your project, it comes with many declarations that is part of JavaScript standard, e.g. `Array.prototype.map`, and `Object.keys`, so Intellisense just works when you use those standard JavaScript object method.

However, assuming that your company extends those global object with its own custom methods (I am not saying this is a good idea), how do you make TypeScript recognize it?

Since extending object in JavaScript is something many people used to do, TypeScript provides you a mechanism to do it. Just like you can merge JavaScript object, you can merge declaration in TypeScript.

## Extend Global Object & Declarations

To extends global object e.g. `Array`, include the following code in any TypeScript file in your project:

```ts
declare global {
  interface Array<T> {
    fly: () => void;
  }
}
```

<img src={extendArrayImg} alt="Intellisense showing additional array methods" />

<aside>

It may or may not works depends on where you add the code:

- if you add it into a **script**, it will not work.
- if you add it into a **module**, it would works.

If it doesn't work (which means you had added to a **script**), remove the **declare** clauses so that it becomes:

```ts noWrapper
interface Array<T> {
  fly: (param: string) => void;
}
```

What is the difference between **script** and **module**? I will leave that for another day.

</aside>

Because TypeScript also declare `Array` under global, when it sees the code above, it will interpret that as your intention to add additional methods to `Array`, so it merge that into the original `Array.prototype` declaration.

The same approach is used to add your custom web component tag so TypeScript allow it to be part of JSX:

```ts
declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      'my-custom-component': any;
    }
  }
}
```

Then you can render that it in your React component:

```tsx
const MyComponent: React.FC = () => (
  <div>
    <my-custom-component></my-custom-component>
  </div>
);
```

<aside>

Fun fact: the following also able to add custom tag to JSX

```ts noWrapper
declare global {
  module JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      'my-custom-component': any;
    }
  }
}
```

This is because a global module and global namespace are both global variable.

Fine, this is not fun, just confusing.

</aside>

## Extend Third Party Declaration

Now assuming you're using some third-party libraries that allows you to extend it, e.g. Jest [allows you to extends its `expect` assertion][expect-extend], how do you make its declaration includes your customization as well?

Assuming I want to add a `toBeAwesome` assertion, following is how I do it:

```ts
declare global {
  namespace jest {
    interface Matchers<R> {
      toBeAwesome(): R;
    }
  }
}
```

<img src={extendJestExpectImg} alt="Intellisense showing toBeAwesome" />

It is awesome, isn't it?

## Mechanism

In short, to extend global or third-party declaration, usually you need to additional declaration to make TypeScript merge that in.

To do that, you need to find out how the current declaration is being declared. If it is declared as a global interface, declare a global interface (like `Array`); if it is declared under a namespace, declare that under the namespace too (like `JSX.IntrinsicElements` and `jest.Matcher`).
