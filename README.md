Source code for Malcolm Kee's [personal site](https://malcolmkee.com/) and workshop materials.

Workshop materials:

- [Web Developer Toolbox](https://malcolmkee.com/web-developer-toolbox)

## Code Snippet MDX Usage

This site is powered by [`gatsby-mdx`][gatsby-mdx], which enable the code editor in the markdown.

Live code editor mode will be enabled for two cases:

- the language is `js` (`javascript` will not be live code editor).
- the language is `jsx` with prop `live`

The props can be provided like this:

````md
    ```jsx live fileName=src/example.js
    () => <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    ```
````

The following props are supported:

- `fileName`: add fileName above the code snippet. Handy to indicate which file you're working on.
- `noWrapper`: remove the wrapper around code snippet. This is to remove the clutter.
- `highlightedLines`: comma-separated line numbers to be highlighted. This is not recommended if you can use special comments below, but some languages doesn't support comment (like JSON).

Only applicable for language `jsx`:

- `live`: make the code live editor.
- `noInline`: make the render of component requires the call of `render`. This is actually props of `react-live`.
- `noCode`: only shows the rendered result of the code, but not the code itself.

### Highlight Code

In addition, if the code snippets are not rendered as live code editor, you can highlight specific lines with the following special comments:

- highlight-next-line
- highlight-start
- highlight-end
- hightlight-line

## Local Build Time Optimization

It's possible to disable specific pages to optimize local build time by adding the following variables to a `env.development` file:

```
DISABLE_BLOG=true
NUM_OF_BLOGS=15
DISABLE_WORKSHOP=true
ONLY_WORKSHOP=intro-to-react-js-v2 # content id of workshop
```
