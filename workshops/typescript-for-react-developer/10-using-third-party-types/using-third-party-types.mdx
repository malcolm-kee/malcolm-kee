## Using Types from TypeScript and Libraries

- `classnames` package does not comes with typings. Install `@types/classnames` (which we did previously).
- `Slide` that use `react-transition-group`. Install `@types/react-transition-group`.

## Extending Third-Party Typing

Examples: `share` function that use [`navigator.share` Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share).

Examples: `Image` component that use `loading` props on `img` tag.

Examples: `DateInput` using `JQuery`
