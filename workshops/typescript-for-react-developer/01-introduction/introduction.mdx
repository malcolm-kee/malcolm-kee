## Why Use TypeScript in React Project

TypeScript makes your code easier to maintained:

1. it is easier and safer to refactor.
1. it reduces bug (by catching error in build time instead of runtime).
1. it make code self-documented.

However, TypeScript has some downsides too:

1. Definitely higher learning curve than JavaScript.
1. Slightly less references and helps compared to JavaScript.
1. May take longer time to write, especially when you're still new.

## Why Learn TypeScript as React Developer

1. Better job prospect

    ![Ryan Florence:Side note. TypeScript is taking over. It has gained rapid adoption in 2018 and its embarrassing that I don't know it. If you're looking for a job, there's a 50/50 chance your next code base will be using it if my workshop attendees are any sort of decently random sample.](ryan-florence-typescript-comment.png)

1. Improves your JavaScript skill

    Just like React helps you to write better JavaScript by making write pure function a second nature, TypeScript would help you to write better JavaScript by making you more thoughtful about your data structure. Many times when a code is hard to implement in TypeScript because it is dynamic, it is probable that you had over-complicated your code.

## This Workshop Covers

1. TypeScript fundamentals required to use it in React
1. How to slowly migrate your React codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript
1. Common coding pattern when using TypeScript with React

## This Workshop Does Not Cover

1. React fundamentals (covered in another workshop, [Introduction to React v2](/intro-to-react-js-v2))
1. Modern JavaScript (covered in another workshop, [JavaScript: The React Parts](/js-the-react-parts))
1. All TypeScript concepts (I only focus on those most relevant to React)
1. How to configure TypeScript pipeline (I will cheat and use Create React App)

## Overview of Code-Along Project

In this workshop we will migrate an existing React project to use TypeScript.

The site is called Shopit, an E-commerce SPA.

- [Live version](https://shopit.space/)
- [Code repository](https://github.com/malcolm-kee/react-ecomm-site)
- [Branch that we will start with](https://github.com/malcolm-kee/react-ecomm-site/tree/redux)
- [Branch we will aims to target](https://github.com/malcolm-kee/react-ecomm-site/tree/redux-ts) (use this as reference when you're stuck)

<Exercise title="Project Setup">

Let's setup the project locally before we go further:

1. Clone the project and checkout `redux` branch:

   ```bash noWrapper
   git clone -b redux https://github.com/malcolm-kee/react-ecomm-site.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash noWrapper
   cd react-ecomm-site
   yarn
   ```

   _If you have not installed `yarn`, replace the `yarn` command with `npm install`._

</Exercise>

Libraries used in the project:

- [Create React App][create-react-app] for build pipleline.
- [`@reach/router`][reach-router] for client-side routing.
- [`redux`][redux] for state management.
- [`react-styleguidist`][react-styleguidist] for component development environment.

Don't worry if you're not familar with those libraries as I will explain them whenever required. But don't get excited that you will master all of them after this workshop, I will not go deep into them.

The focus of this workshop is using TypeScript in React. The reason I include those libraries into the project is to make it more like a real-life project so that it is easier for you to translate what you learn today and apply them to your work.

## Setup

To avoid the workshop time being spent on downloading and installing tools, make sure you have the following software installed before the workshop starts:

- node.js and npm ([Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- git ([Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- VS Code ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)) - you can use other editor if you wish, but VS Code has best default TypeScript integration as far as I know, as VS Code team work closely with TypeScript team within Microsoft.

Besides, sign up a [GitHub] account if you doesn't have one yet.

## Looking Ahead

The lessons of the workshops will be vaguely consists of the following sections:

1. Intro and prerequisite: we will discuss what is TypeScript and its relationship with JavaScript. We will also briefly go through React Styleguidist, a library that help you to develop React components in isolation as this is where we will write our code today.

1. TypeScript fundamentals: we will discuss the basic concepts in TypeScript, how to use it, and how it will catch type error.

1. TypeScript in React: we will get our hand dirty by installing TypeScript in our React projects, applying what we have learnt. And then we will discuss a slightly advanced topics like generics and typeguard and how to use them in React.
