## Why Learn TypeScript as React Developer

1. Make code more maintainable

   - code is self-documented
   - easier to refactor
   - catch error earlier (in build time compared to run time)

1. Better job prospect

## This Workshop Covers

1. TypeScript fundamentals
1. How to slowly migrate your React codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript
1. Common coding pattern when using TypeScript with React

## This Workshop Does Not Cover

1. React fundamentals (covered in another workshop, [Introduction to React v2](/intro-to-react-js-v2))
1. Modern JavaScript (covered in another workshop, [JavaScript: The React Parts](/js-the-react-parts))

## Overview of Code-Along Project

In this workshop we will migrate an existing React project to use TypeScript.

The site is called Shopit, an E-commerce SPA.

- [Live version](https://shopit.space/)
- [Code repository](https://github.com/malcolm-kee/react-ecomm-site)
- [Branch that we will start with](https://github.com/malcolm-kee/react-ecomm-site/tree/redux)
- [Branch we will aims to target](https://github.com/malcolm-kee/react-ecomm-site/tree/redux-ts) (use this as reference when you're stuck)

<Exercise title="Project Setup">

Let's setup the project locally before we go further:

1. Clone the project and checkout `redux` branch:

   ```bash noWrapper
   git clone -b redux https://github.com/malcolm-kee/react-ecomm-site.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash noWrapper
   cd react-ecomm-site
   yarn
   ```

   _If you have not installed `yarn`, replace the `yarn` command with `npm install`._

</Exercise>

Libraries used in the project:

- [Create React App][create-react-app] for build pipleline.
- [`@reach/router`][reach-router] for client-side routing.
- [`redux`][redux] for state management.
- [`react-styleguidist`][react-styleguidist] for component development environment.

Don't worry if you're not familar with those libraries as I will explain them whenever required. But don't get excited that you will master all of them after this workshop, I will not go deep into them.

The focus of this workshop is using TypeScript in React. The reason I include those libraries into the project is to make it more like a real-life project so that it is easier for you to translate to your work.
