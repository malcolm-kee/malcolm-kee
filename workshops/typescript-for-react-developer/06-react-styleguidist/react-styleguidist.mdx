[React Styleguidist][react-styleguidist] is a component development tools that would improves the workflow and code reuse in React project.

By default, it allows you to document your React component using comments, the [`prop-types`][prop-types] library and the component use cases with markdown files.

To show you an example, `Button` component in Shopit is documented with:

- component description using comment [here](https://github.com/malcolm-kee/react-ecomm-site/blob/redux/src/components/button.jsx#L5)
- supported props using `prop-types` [here](https://github.com/malcolm-kee/react-ecomm-site/blob/redux/src/components/button.jsx#L31).
- use cases with markdown [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malcolm-kee/react-ecomm-site/redux/src/components/button.md).
- output from React Styleguidist can be seen [here](https://react-ecomm-docs.netlify.com/#button).

For this workshop, we can customize React Styleguidist so we can use TypeScript to document our component instead of `prop-types`.

## Benefits of Using Component Development Tools

1. allows you to develop component in isolation. This allows you to ignore the business rules and focus on developing a reusable UI component.
1. encourage component reuse as it is easier to explore and try the components that have been developed.
1. reduce need of manual documentation. As documentation are generated with comment and code itself, you do not need to worry about outdated documentation.
1. ease communications with designers and business stackholders. It is a great tools when all your UI components is available in single page that you can compare and highlight variation and inconsistency.

If you wish to setup React Styleguidist for your project, you can refer to their [installation docs](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/getting-started.html). The steps are quite straightforward especially if your project is setup with Create React App.

## Configure Styleguidist to Parse TypeScript

By default, React Styleguidist use `prop-types` to generate documentation but we want it to generate from our TypeScript code.

Let's configure it with the following steps.

1. Install `react-docgen-typescript`, which will generates metadata from TypeScript code in the format that React Styleguidist can understand.

    ```bash
    yarn add -D react-docgen-typescript
    ```

2. Configure React Styleguidist to use `react-docgen-typescript` by editing `styleguide.config.js`.

    ```js fileName=styleguide.config.js
    const path = require('path'); // highlight-line

    module.exports = {
    components: 'src/components/**/*.{jsx,tsx}',
    // highlight-start
    propsParser: (filePath, source, resolver, handlers) => {
        const { ext } = path.parse(filePath);
        return ext === '.tsx'
        ? require('react-docgen-typescript').parse(
            filePath,
            source,
            resolver,
            handlers
            )
        : require('react-docgen').parse(source, resolver, handlers);
    },
    // highlight-end
    template: {
        head: {
        links: [
            {
            rel: 'stylesheet',
            href: 'https://bootswatch.com/3/cerulean/bootstrap.min.css'
            }
        ]
        }
    }
    };
    ```
