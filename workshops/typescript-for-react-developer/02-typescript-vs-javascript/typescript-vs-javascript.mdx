## Any Valid JavaScript is Valid TypeScript

![TypeScript is superset of JavaScript](ts-js-venn.png)

TypeScript was designed to inter-operate with JavaScript seamlessly, therefore its language include JavaScript itself, with type annotation and a few JavaScript features that are yet to be standardized (e.g. decorator).

As a metaphor, TypeScript to JavaScript is like

- SASS is to CSS
- (if you're old enough) C++ is to C

In all cases, the former includes the latter and comes with more programming constructs.

<aside>

The metaphors also bring up a good point: mastery of the simpler language (JavaScript/CSS) is not required before you learning the more advanced one (TypeScript/SASS), but you must have at least moderate level of understanding of the simpler language to avoid getting overwhelmed.

## TypeScript !== OOP

One common misconception is that writing TypeScript means you will learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Unfortunately (or fortunately?) that is not the case.

Just like in JavaScript, even though OOP is supported in TypeScript, but that is not required.

In fact, I use TypeScript for more than two years and I seldom need to do OOP unless it is required by the framework/library.

Evan You, the creator of Vue, shared his thoughts on how TypeScript actually reduces the use of `class` when Vue migrates to TypeScript.

![Evan You: Ironically I think TypeScript has helped me more with avoiding classes than using them. Vue 3 is a 100% TS codebase with 0 usage of classes.When shapes of objects can be expressed and checked purely in type land with interfaces, the actual implementation can just be plain literal objects. Instead of class methods, I just pass the objects around to plain functions.This isn't even about FP vs OO as some may assume - there's still a lot of mutable state and imperative code - it's just that with a type system they can be cleanly managed without classes.](evan-you-comments-on-typescript.png)

## You can Use Both JavaScript and TypeScript in a Project

You may think that if you want to use TypeScript, you have to start a new project or rewrite everything from JavaScript to TypeScript.

Luckily, TypeScript allows you to use TypeScript and JavaScript together. You can start slow by writing new codes in TypeScript, then only when you have time to spare, converting the old code from JavaScript to TypeScript.

In fact, that's how we will learn in this workshop: migrating a React project written in JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Jargons Demystified

"Type-checking", "strongly typed", "type annotation"... many fancy words are thrown around when you try to learn TypeScript, which could be overwhelming.

One way to think about all these is using TypeScript is nothing but making your code assumption explicit so that you can allow computer to cross-check assumptions throughout your code are aligned.

Consider the following example:

```js live
const append = (array, item) => array.concat(item);
const excludeUndefined = array => array.filter(item => typeof item !== 'undefined');

const newList = append([1, 2, undefined, 6], undefined);
const numbers = excludeUndefined(newList);
console.log({ numbers })

/* Uncomment the code below and you will get error */
// const newList2 = append('malcolm', undefined);
// const newName = excludeUndefined(newList2);
// console.log({ newName });
```

When we write the function `append` and `excludeUndefined`, we assume the first parameter is an array. However because JavaScript is a weakly-typed language, you can pass a string to the functions, and JavaScript will still allows you to do so, which cause an error when the code runs.

Using TypeScript, we can document our code explicitly, like below. (Don't worry about the syntax, which I will explain in details later)

```ts live
const append = <T>(array: T[], item: T): T[] => array.concat(item);
const excludeUndefined = <T>(array: Array<T | undefined>): T[] => array.filter(item => typeof item !== 'undefined');

const newList = append([1, 2, undefined, 6], undefined);
const numbers = excludeUndefined(newList);
console.log({ numbers })

/* Uncomment the code below and you will get error from TypeScript */
// const newList2 = append('malcolm', undefined);
// const newName = excludeUndefined(newList2);
// console.log({ newName });
```

Now that TypeScript will start yelling at us when we pass a string to the `append` function as it contradicts the assumption of the `append` function, so that we can fix our code even without running the code.

- When you state your assumptions of variable/parameter, you are *declaring type* or *adding type annotation*.
- The process of TypeScript validates all your types does not contradicts each other (e.g. assume function accept array but pass it string) is known as *type-checking*.
- Because TypeScript able to support this process of declaring type (states assumption of data type of variable or parameter), TypeScript is considered as a *strongly-typed language*.
