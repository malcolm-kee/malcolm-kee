## Any Valid JavaScript is Valid TypeScript

![TypeScript is superset of JavaScript](ts-js-venn.png)

As shown in the diagram above, TypeScript includes JavaScript, but more than that.

In other words, you need to know JavaScript before TypeScript.

## TypeScript !== OOP

You may have the misconception that writing TypeScript means you will learn Object-Oriented Programming. Unfortunately (or fortunately?) that is not the case.

You can use OOP with TypeScript, but that is not required, just like JavaScript.

In fact, I use TypeScript for more than a year and I seldom need to do OOP unless it is required by the framework/library.

## You can use Both JavaScript and TypeScript in a Project

You may think that if you want to use TypeScript, you have to rewrite everything from JavaScript to TypeScript.

Luckily, TypeScript allows you to use TypeScript and JavaScript together. You can start slow by writing some files in TypeScript, then converting the code from JavaScript to TypeScript only when you have time.

In fact, that's how we will learn in this workshop, migrating a React project written in JavaScript to TypeScript.
