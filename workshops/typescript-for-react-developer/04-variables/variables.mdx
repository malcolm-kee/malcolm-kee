Before we start our migration of React component, let's have an overview of TypeScript types and syntax.

## Basic Variable and Type Declaration

```ts editorOnly
/**
 * x is a string (inferred)
 */
// let x = "hello js";

/**
 * reassignment is fine
 */
// x = "hello ts";

/**
 * but it will error if we try to change type
 */
// x = 42; // Error

/**
 * let's look at const. The type is literally 'hello'
 */
// const y = "hello";

/**
 * This is called a 'string literal type'. y can never be reassigned since it's a const,
 * so we can regard it as only ever holding a value that's literally the string 'hello world'
 * and no other possible value
 */
// if (y === 'whurt') {} // this check is unnecessary

/**
 * sometimes we need to declare a variable without initializing it
 */
// let z;
// z = 41;
// z = "abc"; // oh no! TypeScript didn't error

/**
 * If we look at the type of z, it's `any`. This is the most flexible type
in TypeScript
 */

/**
 * we could improve this situation by providing a type annotation
 * when we declare our variable
 */
// let zz: number;
// zz = 41;
// zz = "abc"; // ERROR, yay!
```

Takeaways:

1. TypeScript will help to infer types of a variable for you. It will try to be as strict as possible based on how JavaScript works, but not so strict that it makes you waste time on fighting the it.
1. But TypeScript could not read your mind, so you would need to declare the type explicitly in some case.

## Array and Tuple

Takeaways:

1. TypeScript inference will give preference to the most common usage pattern in JavaScript, e.g. prefer Array over Tuple.

## Object

## Intersection & Union

## Function
