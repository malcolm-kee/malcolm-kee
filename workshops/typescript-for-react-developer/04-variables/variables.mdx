Before we start our migration of React component, let's have an overview of TypeScript types and syntax.

## Basic Variable and Type Declaration

[Exercise file](basic-variables.ts)

Takeaways:

1. TypeScript will help to infer types of a variable for you. It will try to be as strict as possible based on how JavaScript works, but not so strict that it makes you waste time on fighting the it.
1. But TypeScript could not read your mind, so you would need to declare the type explicitly in some case.

## Array and Tuple

[Exercise file](array-and-tuple.ts)

Takeaways:

1. TypeScript inference will give preference to the most common usage pattern in JavaScript, e.g. prefer Array over Tuple.

## Object

## Intersection & Union
