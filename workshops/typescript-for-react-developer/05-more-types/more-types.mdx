## Type Alias

Type alias is the naming of type, so you can reuse it.

```ts live
// instead of
const sanitize = (data: string | number) => {};
const clean = (data: string | number) => {};

// create a type alias to reuse
type StringOrNumber = string | number;
const sanit = (data: StringOrNumber) => {};
const clea = (data: StringOrNumber) => {};
```

Type alias is not limited to primitive, you can use it to name object type or function signature as well.

```ts live
type Job = {
  name: string;
  salary: number;
};

const a: Job = {
  name: 'programmer',
  salary: 0,
};

type Callback = () => void;

const hello: Callback = () => {
  console.log('Hello!');
};

type NumberOrStringArray = Array<number | string>;

const items: NumberOrStringArray = [3, 'three', 4, 5];
```

## Interface

Interface can be used to describe object and function. Interface cannot be used to describe primitive, such as `string` or `boolean`.

```ts live
interface Job {
  name: string;
  salary: number;
}

interface SuckyJob extends Job {
  boring: true;
}
```

Most of the thing that you can do using `interface` can be done using `type`, so I usually just use `type` whenever possible.

<aside>

What are the things that `interface` can do but `type` can't?

1. declaration merging (extending an existing interface). This is usually only concerned by library developer, in which their interface can be extended.
1. self-reference. Because `type` is eagerly evaluated, therefore you can't use declare a `type` that refers itself. Meanwhile, `interface` is lazily evaluated, therefore it can refer itself. Nonetheless, this limitation of `type` will be removed in TypeScript 3.7, which is in beta when I am writing this.

## Index signature

```ts live
type Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  phone: string;
}

type PersonMap = {
  [id: string]: Person;
}

const personMap: PersonMap = {
  malcolm: {
    name: 'Malcolm',
    age: 29,
    phone: '0139944857'
  }
}
```
