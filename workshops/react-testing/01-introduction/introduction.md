Testing is one of the essential steps in professional software development.

The question is not whether you test or not, it's how you test it.

Writing automated testing is to automate the testing process.

## Benefits of Writing Tests

- catch bugs before your user do
- avoid regression: maintain your software quality as project grows
- improve confidence of your code
- instant development feedback loop

## Costs of Writing Tests

- more code to write and maintain

## Objectives of This Workshop

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to

- write unit test for single function
- write unit test for single React component
- write integration test for your application
- mock dependencies, api calls, and timer
- discuss principles of maintainable tests: what to test and what to mock
- write end-to-end test using Cypress

The tools that we'll use:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io)

## This Workshop Does Not Cover

- how to setup Jest for your project (we'll use project created with Create React App, which already configure Jest for us)
