In most large-scale React applications, it is very common that your users would not need all features everytime they access your applications. Therefore, it's better if you can split the code to multiple chunks and only send down the chunks that is required (lazy-loading).

This used to be very difficult to do in a scalable way. However, thanks to webpack (and other bundler like Parcel), it has becoming very easy to setup.

We will starts with lazy-loading some Javascript code, then lazy-loading React component.

## Lazy Loading JS code

To start lazy-loading JS code, the most straightforward way is through the dynamic [`import()`][dynamic-import] syntax.

We will lazy load the `axios` library in `api.js`.

Let's update `api.js`:

```javascript
// highlight-next-line
const getAxios = () => import('axios');

const MOVIE_ENDPOINT = 'https://react-intro-movies.herokuapp.com/movies';

export const loadMovies = () =>
  // highlight-start
  getAxios()
    .then(axios => axios.default(MOVIE_ENDPOINT))
    // highlight-end
    .then(res => res.data);

export const createMovie = movie =>
  // highlight-start
  getAxios()
    .then(axios => axios.post(MOVIE_ENDPOINT, movie))
    // highlight-end
    .then(res => res.data);

export const saveMovie = movie =>
  // highlight-start
  getAxios()
    .then(axios => axios.put(`${MOVIE_ENDPOINT}/${movie.id}`, movie))
    // highlight-end
    .then(res => res.data);
```

- The `import axios from 'axios';` statement at the beginning of the file is removed.
- We define a function `getAxios`, which will use dynamic `import` to load the code.
- For all the code that previously use `axios`, not it need to call `getAxios` function to get the axios code, then use it to make the api calls.
- Note that for `loadMovies`, which previously call axios directly with `axios(MOVIE_ENDPOINT)`, it need to call `axios.default(MOVIE_ENDPOINT)` now as the result of dynamic import will cause default export to be associated to the `.default` properties.

Now you would see the following output:

```bash
Hash: f9f3a764f70be0b6cc25
Version: webpack 4.28.4
Time: 1229ms
Built at: 2019-01-07 21:45:12
Asset        Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
      0.js    57.2 KiB       0  [emitted]
      1.js  1000 bytes       1  [emitted]
index.html   470 bytes          [emitted]
   main.js    1.18 MiB    main  [emitted]  main
Entrypoint main = main.js
```

And from the Network tab of your DevTools, you should be able to see chunk `0.js` and `1.js` are loaded.

### Do It: lazy loading ajax call code

1.  modify `api.js` to lazy-load `axios`.
1.  test the application and ensure the code still works as before.

## Lazy Loading React Component

Once you understand dynamic `import()` for JS code, lazy-loading React Components is just using it with helper from React.

We would like to lazy load our `Movie` component.

1.  We need to export `Movie` component with `default export`

```javascript
export const Movie = props => ();

export default Movie; // highlight-line
```

2.  Modify `app.js`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BusyContainer } from './busy-container';

const Movie = React.lazy(() => import('./components/movie')); // highlight-line

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <TitleBar>
        <h1>React Movie App</h1>
      </TitleBar>
      <div className="container">
        <div>
          <div className="button-container">
            <Button onClick={toggleShowMovies}>
              {moviesShown ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} Movies
            </Button>
          </div>
          {moviesShown && (
            <BusyContainer isLoading={isLoading}>
              {/* highlight-next-line */}
              <React.Suspense fallback={<span className="spinner" />}>
                {movies.map(movie => (
                  <Movie
                    name={movie.name}
                    releaseDate={movie.releaseDate}
                    onClick={() => selectMovie(movie)}
                    key={movie.id}
                  />
                ))}
                {/* highlight-next-line */}
              </React.Suspense>
            </BusyContainer>
          )}
        </div>
        ...
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- We wrap dynamic `import` statement with `React.lazy`, so that React knows this is a lazy-loaded Component.
- We wrap lazy-loaded component with `React.Suspense` so that React will fallback to the loading indicator whenever any component within the `React.Suspense` is waiting to be loaded.

That's it!
