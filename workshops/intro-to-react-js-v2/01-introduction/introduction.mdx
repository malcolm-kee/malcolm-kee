This workshop is "An Introduction to React JS", which will introduces you the core of React.

- [Code-along Repo][code-along-repo]
- [v1 website][v1-website]

## This Workshop will Cover

- Core API of React
- common use cases when using React JS e.g. making api call, routing, testing, code splitting
- React hook feature

## This Workshop will NOT Cover

- Basics of HTML, CSS, & Javascript
- React Class Component
- Advanced React Patterns e.g. Higher Order Components and Render Props
- Tooling to use with React, e.g. webpack, Babel, ESLint. We'll use Create React App to abstract away all the tooling. If you're interested to learn about those tools, refer to [version 1][v1-website] of this workshop.
- Redux
- Typescript/Flow

## Prerequisite

This workshop assumes that:

- you have at least basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JS. If you know how to add a button element in a HTML and a script tag to make clicking the button do something interactive like a popup, then you're good to go. If you're not ready, go through this [Introduction to Web Development][intro-to-webdev] workshop.
- you have at least basic experience using command line interface. If you know how to change directory with `cd` and create folder with `mkdir`, then you're good to go. If you're not, go through this [Codecademy course][cli-course] - Module 1 (Navigating the File System) and Module 2 (Viewing and Changing the File System) are sufficient for this course.

Nice to have:

- skim through the contents of this [workshop][js-the-react-parts]. The more familiar with the concepts of the workshop, the more you will absorb from this workshop.
