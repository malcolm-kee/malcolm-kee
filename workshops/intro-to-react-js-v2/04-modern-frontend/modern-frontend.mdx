In last section, we've used Create React App to create our React project and transfer our code into it.

Before we proceed further, let's take a step back and review what is the benefits tools like Create React App bring us and how we can utilize them.

## Benefits of Modern Frontend Development Tools

Modern frontend development tools like Create React App enables us to:

1.  create a web server that will serve our local code and automatically refresh our page when code change (you can try to change the code in `index.js` and see the magic),
1.  compile our code with new JS syntax to older syntax (using [Babel]), so that we can support older browser (you can try open the previous code with IE, and it won't run due to syntax error; but if you open the URL [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with IE now, it works!),
1.  creating optimized code to be used in production in which comments are stripped out and code are minified (run `npm run build` and you'll see the minified code in a `build` folder),
1.  integrate JS, CSS, and HTML file automatically (no more manual change the script tag),
1.  enable a module system that we can use to structure our code effectively but at the same time produce a single bundled JS file so it can be loaded easily (more on this later),
1.  make powerful tactics like code-splitting possible (explained in later section), and
1.  many more than could be possibly explained here, e.g. typechecking, Hot Reload.

## The Module System

A module system allows us to specify what is the dependency of a piece of code and what functionality this code expose to others.

JS module system consists of the following rules:

1.  a file is a module
1.  you use `import` to states what is the dependency of this module (file).
1.  you use `export` to states what is accessible by others from this module (file).

Now looking at `index.js` file:

```javascript fileName=src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
...
```

- the two `import` statements states that this file depends on the two packages, `react` and `react-dom`. When the tools see the statement above, it will look into the `node_modules` folder for `react` and `react-dom`, which you should be able to see.
- we no longer need to include the two unpkg script tags because now they are included as part of final bundled code.

### Utilizing the Module System

If you realize, currently our `index.js` consists of 3 parts: the `Movie` component, the `App` component, and the rendering code. Let's split them up:

1.  create a `components` folder in `src` folder, and add a `movie.js` file in it with the following content:

    ```javascript fileName=src/components/movie.js
    import React from 'react';

    export const Movie = props =>
      React.createElement('div', { className: 'movie-container' }, [
        React.createElement('h1', {}, props.name),
        React.createElement('h2', {}, props.releaseDate),
      ]);
    ```

1.  create a `app.js` file next to `index.js` with the following content:

    ```javascript fileName=src/app.js
    import React from 'react';
    import { Movie } from './components/movie';

    function App() {
      return React.createElement('div', {}, [
        React.createElement(
          'div',
          { className: 'title-bar' },
          React.createElement('h1', {}, 'React Movie App')
        ),
        React.createElement(Movie, {
          name: 'Aquaman',
          releaseDate: '2018-12-07',
        }),
        React.createElement(Movie, {
          name: 'Bumblebee',
          releaseDate: '2018-12-15',
        }),
        React.createElement(Movie, {
          name: 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald',
          releaseDate: '2018-11-14',
        }),
      ]);
    }

    export default App;
    ```

1.  Lastly, modify `index.js` to following:

    ```javascript fileName=src/index.js
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import App from './app';

    ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById('root'));
    ```

The code should still works as before.

- Our code is now split into smaller modules and the dependencies of each code is clearer while still produce a single bundled output.
- There are two ways to use `export`:
  1.  named export: we expose to code with a specific name. When other module import it, they need to use the name, e.g. Movie component.
      ```javascript
      // movie.js
      export const Movie = props =>
      ...
      // app.js
      import { Movie } from './components/movie';
      ```
  1.  default export: we expose to code without a specific name. When other module import it, they can name it as they wish, e.g. App component.
      ```javascript
      // app.js
      export default App;
      ...
      // index.js
      import App from './app';
      ```
  1.  Personally in my own project I always use named export (except due to limitation of library/tools, e.g. `React.lazy` only support default export), because I doesn't like to juggle between two syntax and named export works better for VS Code Intellisense. People use both out there, so you need to know both.
- It is common practice to have a `components` folder which consists of reusable UI components without business logic.
- Even though it's still not common practice in React projects, but I recommend to keep your file as [kebab-case], consistent with Angular CLI defaults. This is because file resolution in Windows are case-insensitive, while in Unix is case-sensitive. When you mistype file name, it would works in Windows but breaks in Unix, so better to avoid that possibility with kebab-case convention.
