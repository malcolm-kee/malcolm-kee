## Allow User to Create Movie

It would be nice if our users can create a movie themselves.

### Prerequisite: API Service for Create Movie

Before you can allow user to create movie, first of all the backend API Service must be able to support that.

Luckily our movies API support that. To able to create a movie, install this [Restlet Client][restlet-client], which is a Chrome extension to allow you to make API calls.

After the extension is installed,

1. open the extension by clicking the icon
1. select "POST" in the METHOD dropdown.
1. enter the following URL in the URL bar:
   ```
   https://react-intro-movies.herokuapp.com/movies
   ```
1. add the following content in the BODY field (change it to your favourite movie):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "More Than Blue",
     "releaseDate": "2018-12-27"
   }
   ```
1. click send

Now when you load your app, you should be see your movie is added.

### Add Ajax Call Function to Make the POST Request

Now that we know the actual AJAX call works by using tools, let's proceed to do that with our code.

Create a `createMovie` function in `api.js` that will make the request

```js
export const createMovie = (movie) =>
  axios
    .post('https://react-intro-movies.herokuapp.com/movies', movie)
    .then((res) => res.data);
```

- axios allows you to makes API call with specific method, e.g. `get`, `post`, `put` etc., corresponding to our REST call methods.
- the second parameter of `axios.post` is the body of the data that you want to submit.

### Create Form Component

Now that we have function to make the API call, let's create the form component.

Add a file `movie-form.js` with the following content:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { createMovie } from './api';

class MovieForm extends React.Component {
  state = {
    name: '',
    releaseDate: '',
  };

  handleInputChange = (ev) => {
    const { name, value } = ev.target;
    this.setState({
      [name]: value,
    });
  };

  handleSubmit = (ev) => {
    ev.preventDefault();
    createMovie(this.state);
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="movie-form">
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          <legend>Create Movie</legend>
          <div className="field">
            <label htmlFor="name" className="label">
              Name
            </label>
            <input
              className="input"
              value={this.state.name}
              id="name"
              name="name"
              onChange={this.handleInputChange}
              required
            />
          </div>
          <div className="field">
            <label htmlFor="releaseDate" className="label">
              Release Date
            </label>
            <input
              className="input"
              value={this.state.releaseDate}
              id="releaseDate"
              name="releaseDate"
              type="date"
              onChange={this.handleInputChange}
              required
            />
          </div>
          <div className="button-container">
            <button type="submit" className="submit-button">
              Create
            </button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MovieForm;
```

- we initialize the state with the values for the form.
- we define a `handleInputChange` method, which will be passed to `onChange` props of the input element.
  - This method will extract the `value` and the `name` of the input when you make any change to the input value. We use the name and the value to `setState`.
  - Take note of the `[name]`, which means `name` should be evaluated to its value. Without the `[]`, the setState call will always the value of `name` instead of depending on the `name` properties of the input.
- we define a `handleSubmit` method, which will be passed to `onSubmit` props of the form element. When form is submitted, we will call `createForm` with the state. We call `event.preventDefault` because by default form submission will cause a page refresh, and we doesn't want that.

Now try to use the form, you can see the page is making the AJAX call, and after you refresh the page, the new movie will be there!
