## Why Learn React

- It trains you to be a good JS developer - learn functional programming and JS standards
- It is popular - good job prospect! :moneybag:

## My Goal for this Workshop

I believe that being productive in React requires more than familiar with React API, you also need to know the tooling around React and the value they bring, so you know when to use and modify them.

My hope is that at the end of this workshop,

- you understand when to use the modern frontend development tools, regardless if you're using React, JQuery, or Vue.
- you have sufficient understandings of React and the ecosystem around it that you know what to search for when you encounters a problem
