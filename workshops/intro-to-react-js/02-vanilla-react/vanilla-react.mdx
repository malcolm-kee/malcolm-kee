title: Vanilla React
description: 'Learn to use React without build tools allows us to have better understandings of React API.'
---

We will start learning React by using React with vanilla JS - which means we will not include any tooling first, and only code with a simple HTML file and a script tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://codepen.io/malcolmkee/pen/xmvMNY.css"
    />
    <title>React Movie App</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="root">not rendered</div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.7.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.7.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script>
      // Your code goes here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

- the codepen link is the css that I've created for this workshop to make the code-along app looks nicer. We're not going to discuss about css in this workshop.
- [unpkg] is a CDN for npm, which allows us to explore npm package easily. (If you not sure what is npm, relax. We'll talk about it slightly later.) The two unpkg `script` tag is used to load the two packages we need to develop in ReactJS:
  - React: this is the library to construct React component, which I will introduce you right after this. It contains no way to render the component, it's just the declaration of the component.
  - ReactDOM: the rendering layer. Since we're learning about rendering in browser today, we'll be using ReactDOM. There are other rendering layer e.g. React Native, React 360 etc. Both React and ReactDOM are required, but the their orders do not matter.
- the last `script` tag would be where we write our code. It must be after the two unpkg `script` tags.

<aside>

Pro Tips: If you're using VS Code (which supports emmet out-out-the-box), you can type `html:5` can press Tab key, which will generates most of the code above.

</aside>

In the `<script>` tag, add the following code

```javascript
const App = function() {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    {},
    React.createElement('h1', {}, 'React Movie App')
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById('root'));
```

- We create a component, call it as `App`. React is all about creating component, and a component can be as simple as a function.
- There are two types of component - function component & class component. This is a function component.
- A component must return markup, which is generated by `React.createElement`.
- `React.createElement` is a function that takes three parameters: component type, properties, and children. For HTML element and web component, the component type would be a string.
- `ReactDOM.render` is used to render our `App` component to the HTML. In this case, a div with id `root`.
- Notice we're using `React.createElement` with `App` as a parameter to `ReactDOM.render`. We need an instance of App to render out. App is a class of components and we need to render one instance of App. That's what `React.createElement` does: it makes an instance of a component.
- A React component is not a markup itself; it is a markup generator.

<Exercise title="Exercise">

1. Create a file and name it as `index.html`.
1. Add the code above in the file.

</Exercise>

Modify your code, so that it becomes

```javascript
const Movie = () =>
  React.createElement('div', { className: 'movie-container' }, [
    React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Aquaman'),
    React.createElement('h2', {}, '2018-12-07'),
  ]);

const App = function() {
  return React.createElement('div', {}, [
    React.createElement(
      'div',
      { className: 'title-bar' },
      React.createElement('h1', {}, 'React Movie App')
    ),
    React.createElement(Movie),
    React.createElement(Movie),
    React.createElement(Movie),
  ]);
};

ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById('root'));
```

- to make an element to have multiple children, just pass it an array of elements.
- `Movie` is our second component. I use [arrow function][arrow-function] syntax here, which will have an implicit return if the function body is a single expression
- We can have multiple `Movie` instances by calling `React.createElement` multiple times!
- `className` props will be translated to `class` properties in HTML. This is one of the few instances where React properties and HTML properties are not the same to avoid complication due to reserved JS keywords (`class` is used to declare class in JS), the others are `htmlFor`, `tabIndex` etc.
- If you're seeing console warning about keys, ignore it for now.

<hr />

We have multiple movies but it's not very useful component yet, since not all movies has name Aquaman. Let's make Movie component a bit more useful.

```javascript
const Movie = props =>
  React.createElement('div', { className: 'movie-container' }, [
    React.createElement('h1', {}, props.name),
    React.createElement('h2', {}, props.releaseDate),
  ]);

const App = function() {
  return React.createElement('div', {}, [
    React.createElement(
      'div',
      { className: 'title-bar' },
      React.createElement('h1', {}, 'React Movie App')
    ),
    React.createElement(Movie, {
      name: 'Aquaman',
      releaseDate: '2018-12-07',
    }),
    React.createElement(Movie, {
      name: 'Bumblebee',
      releaseDate: '2018-12-15',
    }),
    React.createElement(Movie, {
      name: 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald',
      releaseDate: '2018-11-14',
    }),
  ]);
};

ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById('root'));
```

- Now `Movie` is a more flexible component that accepts props from its parent.
- `props` (stands for properties) are variables that parent component (`App`) pass to its children (`Movie`).
- All React component accepts `props` as input, and produces the markup (result of `React.createElement`) as its output.

<hr />

As mentioned before, there are 2 types of component - function component and class component. Let's convert `App` to class component.

```javascript
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return React.createElement('div', {}, [
      React.createElement(
        'div',
        { className: 'title-bar' },
        React.createElement('h1', {}, 'React Movie App')
      ),
      React.createElement(Movie, {
        name: 'Aquaman',
        releaseDate: '2018-12-07',
      }),
      React.createElement(Movie, {
        name: 'Bumblebee',
        releaseDate: '2018-12-15',
      }),
      React.createElement(Movie, {
        name: 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald',
        releaseDate: '2018-11-14',
      }),
    ]);
  }
}
```

- `App` is functionally same as before. However, a class component unlocks more powers, like having state and defining lifecycle methods, which will be explained later.
- Each class component must have a `render` method, which must return the result of `React.createElement` call.
- For function component, props are available as first parameter of the function. For class component, props are available via `this.props`.
- Both function component and render method of class component must be pure function, i.e.:
  - given the same input, it always return the same output (markup)
  - it does not have any side effect - you should not make ajax call / add event listener here.
- So, when you should make an ajax call in a React app? That will be answered in part 3 of this course. But before that, let's dive into the tooling around React.

<aside>

**Note: React component must starts with capital later.** React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags, e.g. `<div />`.

</aside>

<Exercise title="Exercise">

1. Add `Movie` component in your code and use it as explained above.
1. Modify your `App` component to a class component
1. (Bonus) Add a new props `genres` in your `Movie` component and render it in a `span` tag.
