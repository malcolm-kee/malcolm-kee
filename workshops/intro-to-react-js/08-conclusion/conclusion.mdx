We have come to the conclusion of this workshop.

## Recap

What we've learnt:

- Tooling
  1. npm - manage project dependencies and task runner
  1. prettier - keep your code base style consistent so it remove the overhead to maintain it
  1. ESLint - help you to maintain coding standards for your project
  1. webpack - bundling and managing all your assets in your project
  1. babel - compile your code from latest syntax to older syntax so you can support backward compatibility
  1. React - the happiness :satisfied:
  1. Jest - test framework that supports most features you need when writing test for Javascript
  1. react-testing-library - helpers to test React component
- Use Cases:
  1. making ajax call (add the `componentDidMount` lifecycle methods)
  1. showing loading indicator (using React state to track status)
  1. write test for Javascript code and React components
  1. code splitting (using dynamic `import`, `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense`)

## Next Step

- Read [React docs][react-docs]. The core API of React is pretty small now, you can finish the whole docs in one-go.
- If you prefer video, there is a free [egghead.io course][eggheadio-react-intro] by Kent C. Dodds. I never go though this course myself, but I learnt from the instructor via other course, and he is a good teacher.
- If you like to read, there is a curated list of resources at [this repo][react-redux-links]. There are too many articles to read there (I never finished them myself), just browse through the list and read what interest you.
- If you want to ask question, [reactiflux] is a good place as there are many helpful people there. It's actually React community that hang out on Discord (a messenger app like Telegram). I hang out there sometimes too.
