We've come to the conclusion of this workshop.

To recap what we've learnt:

- syntactic sugar: template string, destructuring, spread operator, and arrow function
- new JS features: block scope declaration, `Array` methods, ES modules
- advanced fundamentals: closure, functional programming

## What's Missing

There are some topics that I think is important to grasp when programming in React, but not able to cover in this workshop:

1. Asynchronous Programming: callback, `Promise`, and `async/await`. I think the topic is too wide to cover, and thus it's placed under "Extra" for this workshop.
1. Frontend Tooling: `npm`, `webpack`, `babel`. Those are important knowledges when you programming in React because unlike Angular, React is unopinionated on tooling and you would likely need to tweaks them for your specific use case/workflow. I've covered them in my [Intro to React][react-tooling] workshop, you can have a read there, or join [React KL meetup](https://www.meetup.com/kl-react/) for future session.
