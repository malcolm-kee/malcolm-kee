The second new JavaScript features we'll look into are the new Array methods that you'll use heavily in React.

## Traditional Approach to Loop Through Array

The traditional approach, or introduction-to-programming approach to loop through an array and do something about is to use the `for` loop:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const result = [];

for (let index = 0; index < numbers.length; index++) {
  const element = numbers[index];
  result.push(element * 2);
}

console.log(result);
```

What does the code above do? Try to use a single statement to describe the whole purpose of the `for` loop?

<details>
  <summary>Possible Answer (Click to show)</summary>
  <p>
    It doubles each item in <code>numbers</code> array.
  </p>
</details>

For us to figure out the behavior of the code, we need to read though the `for` loop initialization, wondering if we have [off-by-one error][off-by-one-error], and then only look at the actual computation (`element * 2`).

Because transformation of array item is such a common use case, utilities libraries such as [underscore] and [lodash] have the `map` function for this purpose:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = map(numbers, x => x * 2); // [2, 3, 6, 8, 10];
```

The implementation of `map` is just few lines of code:

```js
const map = (array, callback) => {
  const output = [];
  for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
    output.push(callback(array[index]));
  }
  return output;
};
```

Note: `map` use callback function as parameter. If this pattern is new to you, have a read at [callback function](/js-the-react-parts/callback-function).

In fact, transformation of array item is not the only operation you may do when you loop though an array, other common use cases are:

- filter the items based on some condition. Example: keep only number that is larger than 5
- generate a single value from all the items. Example: get sum of all items
- do something with based on each item. Example: append a `div` in body with html equal to the item.

Each of these use case has equivalent utility function:

| Use case                        | Utility function |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Transform each item             | `map`            |
| Filter item                     | `filter`         |
| Generate a single value         | `reduce`         |
| Do something based on each item | `forEach`        |

Since these are so common, they are included in JavaScript as part of the methods of `Array` object.

Now we will go through each of them below.

## Array.map

`map` is the method to do data transformation. `map` will create a new array; the original array will kept unchanged.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubles = numbers.map(num => num * 2);

console.log(doubles); // [2, 4, 6]
console.log(numbers); // no change

const persons = [
  { firstName: 'Bill', lastName: 'Gates' },
  { firstName: 'Michael', lastName: 'Jackson' },
  { firstName: 'Tiger', lastName: 'Woods' },
  { firstName: 'Steve', lastName: 'Jobs' }
];

const names = persons.map(person => `${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`);

console.log(names);
```

The callback that you provide will receive three parameters: element, index, and the whole array, so you can use them for your data transformation.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubleAfterSecond = numbers.map((num, index) =>
  index >= 2 ? num * 2 : num
);

console.log(doubleAfterSecond); // [1, 2, 6];
```

### Exercise

Given the following array:

```js
const participants = [
  { name: 'Abu', ic: '880505-23-4955', gender: 'male' },
  { name: 'Mary', ic: '920505-10-9958', gender: 'female' },
  { name: 'T Chakra', ic: '900505-23-5775', gender: 'male' },
  { name: 'Suzi', ic: '880505-23-4958', gender: 'female' }
];
```

Get the IC numbers for all the participants

## Array.filter

`filter` method is used to filter elements in an array. You do so by providing it a function that will returns `true` or `false`. If `true`, the element will be kept, else it will be discarded. `filter` will create a new Array instead of changing the original array.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4]
console.log(numbers); // still [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], because `filter` doesn't change the original array

const persons = [
  { name: 'Bossku', isMalaysian: true },
  { name: 'Susanto', isMalaysian: false },
  { name: 'John Smith', isMalaysian: false },
  { name: 'Siti Nurhaliza', isMalaysian: true }
];

const malaysians = persons.filter(person => person.isMalaysian);

console.log(malaysians);
```

<aside>

The term and behavior is slightly confusing because in our daily use,
"filter" means exclude, thus return `true` to `filter` implies "exclude it",
but the behavior is return `true` to keep it. In my opinion,
a better alternative is to call it `keep` or invert the behavior.
However, there is nothing we can do now other than use it more often and get used to this misalignment.

</aside>

Similar to `map` method, the callback that you pass to `filter` will receive three parameters: the element, the index, and the whole array. You can use these parameters to determine if an element should be filtered.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const afterFourth = numbers.filter((num, index) => index >= 4); // this will keep fifth items onwards

console.log(afterFourth); // [5, 6];

const half = numbers.filter(
  (num, index, allNumbers) => index >= Math.round(allNumbers.length / 2)
); // this will keep second half of array

console.log(half); // [4, 5, 6]
```

Because both `filter` and `map` returns a new array, it's common to chain them together.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubleOddNumbers = numbers
  .filter(num => num % 2 === 1) // this will returns [1, 3]
  .map(num => num * 2); // this will returns [2, 6]

console.log(doubleOddNumbers);
```

A common use case of `filter` is to pass it the `Boolean` constructor to remove all the falsy value (`undefined`, `null`).

```js
const numbersWithUndefined = [1, undefined, 4, null];
const numbers = numbersWithUndefined.filter(Boolean);
// the code above is equivalent to
// const numbers = numbersWithUndefined.filter(num => Boolean(num));

console.log(numbers); // [1, 4]
```

### Exercise

1. Given the following numbers:

   ```js
   const numbers = [3, -2, 1000, 201, 50, 33, -21];
   ```

   - Get all the positive numbers (above or equal to 0)
   - Get all the odd numbers
   - Get all the number that is larger than the number before it (exclude the first number)

1. Given the following array:

   ```js
   const participants = [
     { name: 'Abu', ic: '880505-23-4955', gender: 'male' },
     { name: 'Mary', ic: '920505-10-9958', gender: 'female' },
     { name: 'T Chakra', ic: '900505-23-5775', gender: 'male' },
     { name: 'Suzi', ic: '880505-23-4958', gender: 'female' }
   ];
   ```

   - Get the IC numbers for all the participants
   - Get the names for female participants only

## Array.reduce

`reduce` method is used to derive a single value by looping through the whole array. It's more abstract and slighlty harder to understand than `filter` and `map`, but it's more powerful.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);

console.log(sum); // 6
```

The `reduce` method accepts 2 parameter, a function and an initial value.

The function you provide accepts four parameters:

- `accumulator` - this is the value that will be changed while you loop through the array. Its initial value is the second parameter you provide to `reduce` method.
- `item` - the array item
- `index` - the index of the item
- `originalArray` - the original array

The value returned by the function will be passed as `accumulator` for the next item, until there is no more item, then the return value will be the output for the whole expression.

Let's walkthough the example above:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = numbers.reduce(
  (total, num) => total + num,
  0
); /* This line could be breakdown as following three steps:
    1. total is 0 (initial value), num is 1 (first item), thus the function returns 1 (0 + 1)
    2. total is 1 (value returned by step 1), num is 2 (second item), thus the function returns 3 (1 + 2)
    3. total is 3 (value returned by step 2), num is 3 (third item), thus the function returns 6 (3 + 3)
    4. because no more items, sum will be 6 (value returned by step 3)
*/
console.log(sum);
```

`reduce` doesn't dictate the type of the `accumulator`, thus you can use it for many purposes:

```js
// counting occurrence
const alphabets = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'c', 'z'];

const summary = alphabets.reduce((result, alphabet) => {
  if (result[alphabet]) {
    return {
      ...result,
      [alphabet]: result[alphabet] + 1
    };
  } else {
    return {
      ...result,
      [alphabet]: 1
    };
  }
}, {});

console.log(summary);
```

```js
// grouping
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const numberGroups = numbers.reduce(
  (result, num) => {
    if (num % 2 === 0) {
      // it's an even number, concat the item to the `even` array
      return {
        ...result,
        even: result.even.concat(num)
      };
    } else {
      // concat the item to the `odd` array.
      return {
        ...result,
        odd: result.odd.concat(num)
      };
    }
  },
  { odd: [], even: [] }
);

console.log(numberGroups.odd);
console.log(numberGroups.even);
```

In fact, you can even use `reduce` to do what `filter` and `map` do. However, this is not advisable because `map` and `filter` (specific use case) communicates the your code's intention better than `reduce` (generic).

```js
// filtering
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.reduce(
  (result, num) => (num % 2 === 0 ? result.concat(num) : result),
  []
); // this is equivalent to numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);

// mapping
const doubles = numbers.reduce((result, num) => result.concat(num * 2), []); // this is equivalent to numbers.map(num => num * 2);
```

### Exercise

Given the following array:

```js
const participants = [
  { name: 'Abu', gender: 'male', paid: true },
  { name: 'Mary', gender: 'female', paid: true },
  { name: 'T Chakra', gender: 'male', paid: false },
  { name: 'Suzi', gender: 'female', paid: true }
];
```

By using `reduce` method, get an object with two properties `paid` and `unPaid`, which are each an array of participants.

## Array.forEach

`forEach` is a method to perform some operation for each item. It doesn't returns anything.

```js
const numbers = [1, 4, 7];

numbers.forEach((num, index) =>
  console.log(`Item at index ${index} is ${num}`)
); /* This will logs:
Item at index 0 is 1
Item at index 1 is 4
Item at index 2 is 7
*/
```

Similar to `filter` and `map`, `forEach` also provide three parameters to the function you pass to it: item, index, and the original array.

<aside>

`forEach` can replace most use cases of `for` loop, thus you seldom need to write for loop anymore.

### Exercise

Given the following array:

```js
const participants = [
  { name: 'Abu', gender: 'male', paid: true },
  { name: 'Mary', gender: 'female', paid: true },
  { name: 'T Chakra', gender: 'male', paid: false },
  { name: 'Suzi', gender: 'female', paid: true }
];
```

By using `forEach` method, get an object with two properties `paid` and `unPaid`, which are each an array of participants.

## Other useful Array methods

There are other handy `Array` methods that I use frequently:

- `Array.find` - get the first item that fulfills a condition. [MDN docs][array-find]
- `Array.includes` - check if an item is in the array. [MDN docs][array-includes]
- `Array.some` - check if at least one item fulfills a condition. [MDN docs][array-some]
- `Array.every` - check if all items fulfills a condition. [MDN docs][array-every]

As your homework, look up the MDN documentations on them.
