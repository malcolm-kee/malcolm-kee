This section we will dive into new features in JavaScript.

One thing that many JavaScript developer didn't realize is that the default scope of variable in JavaScript is function:

```js
function add() {
  var a = 2;
  var b = 5;
  return a + b;
}

// console.log(a); // a is not accessible here

function addIfTrue(isTrue, times) {
  var x = 5;
  if (isTrue) {
    var tmp = x * times;
    x = x + tmp;
  }
  console.log(`tmp: ${tmp}`); // but tmp is accessible here
  return x;
}

console.log(`add: ${add()}`);
console.log(`addIfTrue: ${addIfTrue(true, 2)}`);
```

This is in contrast with most programming languages like Java or C in which the scope of the variable is block (the closest curly braces pair `{}`).

This behavior applies for `for` loop as well:

```js
var y = 0;

for (var x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
  y += x;
}

console.log(y); // 10
console.log(x); // 5, because x is not scoped within the for loop
```

Now JavaScript has two new keywords, `let` and `const`, which will scoped within the block.

```js
function addIfTrue(isTrue, times) {
  var x = 5;
  if (isTrue) {
    let tmp = x * times;
    x = x + tmp;
  }
  // console.log(`tmp: ${tmp}`); // tmp is not accessible here
  return x;
}

var y = 0;

for (let x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
  y += x;
}

console.log(y); // 10
// console.log(x); // x is not accessible here
console.log(`addIfTrue: ${addIfTrue(true, 2)}`);
```

`const` behaves like `let`, but it cannot be reassigned.

```js
let x = 5;
x = 15; // OK

const y = 10;
// y = 15; // Error
```

Today, most JavaScript developers use `const` by default, and switch to `let` when they need to reassign the variable. Very few developer use `var` anymore.

Note that `const` cannot be reassigned doesn't mean it cannot be changed. If the variable is not a primitive value, i.e. `boolean`, `string`, or `number`, it could be modified.

```js
const x = 5; // primitive, you can expect x will always be 5;
const y = []; // not primitive, you may expect it will always be an empty array

y.push(5); // this is fine for JavaScript, because it is not reassigned
y.push(10);

console.log(y); // [5]
```
