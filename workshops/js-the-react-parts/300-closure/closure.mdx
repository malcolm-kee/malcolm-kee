Closure is a concept in JavaScript that you would encounter if you're long enough in JavaScript, but you would seldom see it's being explained clearly. However, I would say without knowing what closure is, it's very likely there is some gaps in your understanding of JavaScript that you don't even aware of.

Because without closure, actually a lot JavaScript code would not work at all.

## A Deeper Look at Scope

Let's look at a code snippet below.

```javascript
let x = 100;

function doA() {
  let x = 5;
  function innerDoA() {
    console.log(x);
  }
  return innerDoA;
}

const logX = doA();

logX(); // what does this log?
```

Before you run it in your console, try to predict what `logX` would log. Is it 5 or is it 100?

<details>
  <summary>Answer (Click to show)</summary>
  <p>5</p>
</details>

**Why?**

Let's try to reason how you may expect it to be 100:

1. Where we run `logX`, we trying to trace back, what's `logX`?
1. `logX` is the result returned by `doA` function. When you looking into `doA`, you realize it actually returns `innerDoA` function, which is declared inside it.
1. Looking into `innerDoA`, where the value of `x` is being logged, we're thinking, what's the value of `x`?
1. To answer the question, we ask ourselves: is there any `x` in `innerDoA` function?
1. Since there is no `x` in `innerDoA`, where should we look at next?

   - By instinct, you may think that that would be global, e.g. the outer `x` (100).
   - `x` at line 4 seems irrelevant because `x` at line 4 is within `doA` function, and the place you call `logX` is outside `doA` function.

However, the reasoning above must has a gap that causing us to predict incorrectly that `x` at line 4 is irrelevant, and that gap is closure.

What is closure?

> Closure is the ability of a function to access variables where the function is **declared**.

With closure, when the line 6 is being executed, how JavaScript lookup `x` works like this:

1. Is there any `x` within the `innerDoA` function? No.
1. Is there any `x` that could be accessed with closure of `innerDoA` function? Yes! `x` at line 4!
1. (If previous check is false), then only will check if `x` is available globally.

Now, you may think, huh, that's interesting, but what's the use of that? I seldom do this returns function pattern in my code, I'm fine!

But the fact is, you may not realize you can returns function, but you do pass function around as a callback right? Then, you're utilizing closure!

Let's see an example:

```js
function getServerTime(callback) {
  const xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

  xmlHttp.open('HEAD', window.location.href);
  xmlHttp.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
  xmlHttp.addEventListener('load', () => {
    // invocation happens here!
    callback(xmlHttp.getResponseHeader('Date'));
  });
  xmlHttp.send('');
}

function checkNetwork() {
  const localTime = new Date();
  function logTime(serverTime) {
    console.log(`localTime: ${localTime}`);
    console.log(`serverTime: ${serverTime}`);
  }
  getServerTime(logTime);
}

checkNetwork();
```

- `getServerTime` is a function that able to get time based on server without any server code. Similar to many function that is asynchronous, it accepts a `callback` parameter so it can call it later.
- `checkNetwork` is a function that will store the local time before call `getServerTime`, and then log both local time and server time.
- Note that the `logTime` is declared within `checkNetwork` function, but the invocation is in `getServerTime`. Without closure, `logTime` would not has access to `localTime` variable.

So, you've been utilizing closure when you learn to program with callback, it's just you never realize it.

With a better understanding of closure (and thus how scope works in JavaScript), let's see the technique we can use with this knowledge.

- currying
- private variables and methods

## Currying with Closure

Currying is a technique that allows you to provide parameters to a function sequentially (instead of in single invocation).

```js
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

console.log(multiply(2, 3));
```

`add` is a function that takes two parameters `x` and `y` and multiply them together.

However, what if you get the value of `x` and `y` in different time? (Imagine a calculator app, where user enter first number, then enter second number later).

You can use currying to achieve that:

```js
function createMultiplier(x) {
  return function multiply(y) {
    return x * y;
  };
}
// the function above can be rewritten as const createMultiplier => x => y => x * y;

const double = createMultiplier(2);
// later
console.log(double(3));
```

`multiply` function works, because it has access to `x` due to closure.

Let's see a more fun example:

```js
document.getElementById('bulbasaur').addEventListener('click', function(ev) {
  document.getElementById(ev.target.dataset.sound).play();
  document.getElementById('selected-pokemon').innerHTML = 'Bulbasaur!';
});

document.getElementById('charmander').addEventListener('click', function(ev) {
  document.getElementById(ev.target.dataset.sound).play();
  document.getElementById('selected-pokemon').innerHTML = 'Charmander!';
});

document.getElementById('squirtle').addEventListener('click', function(ev) {
  document.getElementById(ev.target.dataset.sound).play();
  document.getElementById('selected-pokemon').innerHTML = 'Squirtle!';
});
```

<div id="currying-example" style="margin-bottom:32px;">
  <h2 id="selected-pokemon">Select your Pokemon:</h2>
  <audio id="bulbasaur-sound" src="bulbasaur.ogg" />
  <audio id="charmander-sound" src="charmander.ogg" />
  <audio id="squirtle-sound" src="squirtle.ogg" />
  <button id="bulbasaur" data-sound="bulbasaur-sound" class="btn">
    Bulbasaur
  </button>
  <button id="charmander" data-sound="charmander-sound" class="btn">
    Charmander
  </button>
  <button id="squirtle" data-sound="squirtle-sound" class="btn">
    Squirtle
  </button>
</div>

You may realize there are a lot duplications in the code.

We can remove all the duplication by utilizing currying.

```javascript
const createPokemonClickHandler = pokemonName => ev => {
  document.getElementById(ev.target.dataset.sound).play();
  document.getElementById('selected-pokemon').innerHTML = pokemonName;
};

document
  .getElementById('bulbasaur')
  .addEventListener('click', createPokemonClickHandler('Bulbasaur!'));

document
  .getElementById('charmander')
  .addEventListener('click', createPokemonClickHandler('Charmander!'));

document
  .getElementById('squirtle')
  .addEventListener('click', createPokemonClickHandler('Squirtle!'));
```

We will utilize currying in [next lesson](/js-the-react-parts/functional-programming).

### Exercise

1. Refactor the `map` and `filter` function below to use currying.

```js
const map = (mapper, array) => array.map(mapper);
const filter = (predicate, array) => array.filter(predicate);

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(map(x => x * 2, numbers));
console.log(filter(x => x > 2, numbers));

// after you refactor, uncomment the following code to make sure they produces same result as original
/* 
const double = map(x => x * 2);
const moreThanTwo = filter(x => x > 2);
console.log(double(numbers));
console.log(moreThanTwo(numbers));
*/
```

2. Remove the duplication in the following code by using currying.

```js
document.querySelector('#size-12').addEventListener('click', function(ev) {
  const container = document.querySelector('#currying-exercise');
  container.style.fontSize = '12px';
  container.style.color = ev.target.dataset.color;
});

document.querySelector('#size-14').addEventListener('click', function(ev) {
  const container = document.querySelector('#currying-exercise');
  container.style.fontSize = '14px';
  container.style.color = ev.target.dataset.color;
});

document.querySelector('#size-16').addEventListener('click', function(ev) {
  const container = document.querySelector('#currying-exercise');
  container.style.fontSize = '16px';
  container.style.color = ev.target.dataset.color;
});
```

<div id="currying-exercise" style="margin-bottom:75px;">
  <h5 style="font-size:1.6em;">Currying example</h5>
  <p>I am text</p>
  <div>
    <button id="size-12" data-color="red" class="btn">
      Red 12
    </button>
    <button id="size-14" data-color="blue" class="btn">
      Blue 14
    </button>
    <button id="size-16" data-color="yellow" class="btn">
      Yellow 16
    </button>
  </div>
</div>

## Creating a stateful data with "private" variable and method

Languages such as Java provide ability to declare methods and variables as "private", making sure the methods/variables can only be called by other methods within the class.

JavaScript does not provide a native way to do this, but we can emulate this with closures.

Let's see a practical example.

```js
let _number = 0;

const getId = function() {
  return _number++;
};

console.log(getId());
console.log(getId());
console.log(getId());
console.log(getId());
```

`getId` is a function that will always returns you an unique number everytime it's called. This is achieved by declaring a variable `_number`, which will be incremented everytime `getId` is called.

However, with this code you don't have the assurance that the results of `getId` will be unique because `_number` is a public variable that can be updated by anyone.

```javascript
let _number = 0;

const getId = function() {
  return _number++;
};

console.log(getId());
console.log(getId());
console.log(getId());

// some joker writes the following code
_number = 1;

console.log(getId()); // nope, 1 appear twice :(
```

We can protect our `_number` variable (making it private) by utilizing closure as below:

```javascript
function createIncrementor() {
  let _number = 0;
  function increment() {
    return _number++;
  }
  return increment;
}

const getId = createIncrementor();

console.log(getId());
console.log(getId());
console.log(getId());
console.log(getId());
```

- `createIncrementor` is a function that declares a variable `_number` and a `increment` function, and returns the `increment` function.
- Due to closure, when `increment` is returned and assigned to `getId`, it still has access to `_number` variable, thus we can still use it.
- Now nobody can ever able to update the `_number` variable, thus we can assure `getId` will always returns unique value.
- If you only need one incrementor, you can actually inline the `createIncrementor` function like below:

```javascript
const getId = (function() {
  let _number = 0;
  function increment() {
    return _number++;
  }
  return increment;
})();

console.log(getId());
console.log(getId());
console.log(getId());
console.log(getId());
```

This style of declaring a function and then directly invoke it is known as IIFE (immediately invoked function expression), and it's useful when you have this one-off function to wrap your variables privately.

Following is a slightly more complex example:

```js
let _count = 0;
function _changeBy(val) {
  _count += val;
}
function incrementCount() {
  _changeBy(1);
}
function decrementCount() {
  _changeBy(-1);
}
function countValue() {
  return _count;
}

console.log(`initial value: ${countValue()}`);
incrementCount();
incrementCount();
console.log(`value after increment: ${countValue()}`);
decrementCount();
console.log(`value after decrement: ${countValue()}`);
```

- in the code above,
  - `_count` is a private variable while `_changeBy` is a private function (indicated by naming starting with \_).
  - `incrementCount`, `decrementCount`, and `countValue` are the public function that can be called.
- However, there is no assurance that nobody will mess with `_count` and `_changeBy` directly.
- We can solve this issue by hiding `_count` and `_changeBy` with closure.

```js
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  function changeBy(val) {
    count += val;
  }
  function increment() {
    changeBy(1);
  }
  function decrement() {
    changeBy(-1);
  }
  function value() {
    return count;
  }

  return {
    increment,
    decrement,
    value
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(`initial value: ${counter.value()}`);
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(`value after increment: ${counter.value()}`);
console.log(`count: ${counter.count}`); // you can't access the counter variable directly
console.log(`changeBy: ${counter.changeBy}`); // you can't access changeBy function
```

- `createCounter` is a function that will declare a variable `count` and four functions: `changeBy`, `increment`, `decrement`, and `value`. However, it only returns 3 functions.
- When we call `createCounter`, we only get an object with 3 properties `increment`, `decrement`, and `value`. We can call these 3 functions to call `changeBy` and update/get the value of `count`, but we do not have access to `changeBy` and `count` directly.

Actually, there is a name for this technique: module pattern. Module pattern is very useful when you want to limit the access of your function/variables. In fact, it's used by JavaScript bundler like webpack to simulate ES module.

Module pattern actually highlights an important behavior of closure: the variables within the closure are not just constants, they are actually variables that can be updated, and your closure will access its latest value.

With module pattern, you realize unless required by the framework/library you use, a lot times you don't really need to write object-oriented code in JavaScript, where you need to fight with the tricky behavior of `this` keyword in JavaScript.

Note that the `createCounter` code above could be rewritten in a few ways, but all of them behave the same:

```js
// this code inline the public functions
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  function changeBy(val) {
    count += val;
  }

  return {
    increment: function() {
      changeBy(1);
    },
    decrement: function() {
      changeBy(-1);
    },
    value: function() {
      return count;
    }
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(`initial value: ${counter.value()}`);
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(`value after increment: ${counter.value()}`);
```

```js
// IIFE styles
const counter = (function() {
  let count = 0;
  function changeBy(val) {
    count += val;
  }
  function increment() {
    changeBy(1);
  }
  function decrement() {
    changeBy(-1);
  }
  function value() {
    return count;
  }

  return {
    increment,
    decrement,
    value
  };
})();

console.log(`initial value: ${counter.value()}`);
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(`value after increment: ${counter.value()}`);
```

One more things about using module pattern: since it is a function, it encourages us to look for variables that are hardcoded and write a more reusable code.

Looking at `createCounter` function, you may realize that there is no reason for us to hard-code initial number as 0. We thus, we can make `createCounter` function to accept an initialCount parameter.

```js
function createCounter(initialCount = 0) {
  let count = initialCount;
  function changeBy(val) {
    count += val;
  }

  return {
    increment: function() {
      changeBy(1);
    },
    decrement: function() {
      changeBy(-1);
    },
    value: function() {
      return count;
    }
  };
}

const counter1 = createCounter();
counter1.increment();
console.log(`counter1 count: ${counter1.value()}`);

const counter2 = createCounter(100);
counter2.increment();
console.log(`counter2 count: ${counter2.value()}`);
```

### Exercise

1. Use closure to hide the private variables (`_msgs` and `_shouldLog`) in the code below.

```js
let _msgs = [];
const _shouldLog = true;

const addMsg = msg => {
  _shouldLog && console.log(msg);
  _msgs.push(msg);
};

const getAll = () => [..._msgs];

const clear = () => {
  _shouldLog && console.log('clearing all msg');
  _msgs = [];
};
```

2. Enhance the `createCounter` function to accepts another parameter, `step` that determines the amount it add/minus when you can `increment`/`decrement`.

```js
function createCounter(initialCount = 0) {
  let count = initialCount;
  function changeBy(val) {
    count += val;
  }

  return {
    increment: function() {
      changeBy(1);
    },
    decrement: function() {
      changeBy(-1);
    },
    value: function() {
      return count;
    }
  };
}

const counter1 = createCounter();
counter1.increment();
console.log(`this should equals 1: ${counter1.value()}`);

const counter2 = createCounter(100, 10);
counter2.increment();
console.log(`this should equals 110: ${counter2.value()}`);
```
