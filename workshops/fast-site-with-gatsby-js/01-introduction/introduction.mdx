## Why Gatsby

Before we jump into learning how to write code in Gatsby, let's take a step back and see why you may want to use it for your next project.

### Before: Traditional CMS

Typically, websites are usually managed with content-management system (CMS) like Wordpress and Drupal. CMS allows anyone with basic HTML & CSS knowledge to update the website contents such as text or images without writing any code.

However, using CMS comes with few drawbacks:

1. use the old frontend paradigm
   - states are coupled with DOM
   - slow, manual DOM manipulation
   - document-based sites. Dynamic behavior (go to different page, submit a form) usually involves a full-page reload
   - in other words, many improvements that comes with modern frontend frameworks (e.g. virtual-dom, proper state-management, hot reloading) are not available
1. performance need to be manually managed and hand-tweaked
1. manual content and data migration required when data is available from multiple sources

### After: Gatsby

Gatsby is created to solve these problems:

1. utilize modern frontend technologies (webpack, React, SCSS, GraphQL) that gives you good developer experience and scaleable code management
1. automated performance tuning, e.g. inline critical assets, image optimization, lazy-loading and prefetch contents
1. pull data from anywhere with GraphQL. You can pull data from any API that expose data (including CMS such as Wordpress/Contentful or third-party services such as GitHub or Shopify), or databases (MongoDB/MySQL). You owns your data, and Gatsby allows you to present your data in the format you wish.

In the meantime, content creator can still manage the content via CMS.

How to utilize those features from Gatsby is the goal of this workshop.

### Own Your Data

I love Gatsby and use it for my personal website (the one you're looking at right now) not just because of its features, but also because of I like full control of how I store my data and the user experience.

I can store the contents in a headless-CMS, as a Markdown file in this repository, or in Instagram. The gap between the service and a the UI is usually just a plugin away. My visitors would not need to register another account just to view the contents created by me.

Because Gatsby allows me to distribute my contents into multiple sources as I wish, it's easy to migrate if I'm not happy with any services without requiring major change to my code.

## Workshop Agenda

- Introduction to Concepts in Gatsby
- Create Pages in Gatsby and Deploy It
- Use Gatsby Source Plugins to pull data into our sites
- Dynamically Create Pages from data
- Use Gatsby to optimize our image automatically

We will learn those by creating a personal website with blogs that you can use right after this workshop, which I think you should have one. If you don't think so, perhaps you will after reading [this article][why-personal-website].

If you're not into writing, I think personal website is also a good playground for you to try the technologies that you love or could be too cutting-edge to introduce into your job, such as React and GraphQL.

## Expectation

To get most from this workshop, it's advised that you:

1. before the workshop, read and complete [the setup instructions][gatsby-setup].
1. during the workshop, instead of listening passively, follow along the setup.
1. think how you can apply the knowledge you learn in your personal projects or works. Ask if you have difficulty relates them.
